Some even speculated that the fertilizer company used its connection with the police to silence a critic of its products.The Red Star News report, which cited a police document, said Liang's social media criticisms led to more than 20 villagers making a banner, gathering and protesting and blocking an entrance. The newspaper report didn't mention where the entrance was located.The internet is not a lawless place and net users should use more rationality and be less impulsive, the police said in the statement, adding that posting improper content and insulting others on the internet will be punished by law.  The statement didn't define what constituted an illegal insult to others. Global Times
