"The decision is expected to be formalized through a written procedure," Tusk said on Twitter. On Oct. 20, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent a letter to Tusk for a further extension to the Article 50 negotiating period to Jan. 31, 2020 without signing the letter. Hours before the letter, British lawmakers voted for a key amendment to force Johnson to seek another Brexit extension from the EU. By 322 to 306, MPs supported an amendment put forward by former Conservative MP Oliver Letwin that will withhold parliamentary approval for Johnson's deal until parliament passes the EU withdrawal bill legislation.
