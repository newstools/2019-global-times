With the successful development of technologies like scramjet engines, technical research has gone past the concept stage, it said.Â Space plane is a crucial weapon of the future and represents the trend of integrating aviation and space technologies, the academy said.Many countries have been developing space planes, including the US with its X-37B, which many military observers claim is a prototype space fighter.A space plane can be used for reconnaissance, anti-satellite, anti-ballistic missile and ground attacks if used as a weapon, the military expert said, noting that it can also send satellites and astronauts into space at a lower cost than rockets, because it is reusable and uses standard airports.China unveiled the Tengyun Project in 2016, which is planning the first test flight for the Chinese space plane in 2030, Beijing-based Science and Technology Daily reported in December 2016.
