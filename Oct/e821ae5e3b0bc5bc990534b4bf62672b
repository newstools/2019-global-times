Illustration: Luo Xuan/GTOn Thursday, US Vice President Mike Pence delivered a major speech on the Trump administration's China policy at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, DC. Compared with his tough address on China policy at the Hudson Institute a year ago, and in spite of tedious accusations against China, Pence's speech in general sounded more balanced and conciliatory; at least, he broke no new fronts that could cause an escalation in tensions. As the Trump administration's best-known hawk, his speech might represent a positive move by the White House to start what he called a new future with China, and to ease the tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing specifically.Expected to take a hawkish stance, Pence pulled no punches against Beijing. While praising US President Donald Trump's China policy as a vigorous advancement of the US' interests in the nation's relationship with China, he continued to emphasize China as a "strategic and economic rival."In response to concerns and criticism as to whether the Trump administration seeks to "decouple" from China, he made clear the answer was a firm "No." However, this encouraging answer was immediately followed by extremely conceited terms. When talking about the Trump administration's current negotiations with Beijing that address issues including trade deficits, intellectual property disputes and technology transfers, Pence baselessly reprimanded China for continuing to "aid and abet the theft of our intellectual property," and even more notably, he claimed that if China commits to "ending the trade practices that have taken advantage of the American people for far too long," Trump "is ready and willing to begin that new future." Over the years, China has undertaken a trade policy with the US which largely involves inexpensive but quality export goods, from home appliances to raw steel. The US has apparently forgotten the incredible benefit it derived from these low-cost consumer goods and raw materials, which have improved living standards and hobbled inflation in the US.Pence listed almost every one of the US' grievances with Beijing, showcasing an egotistical and arrogant personality.The US vice president's explicit denials of the Trump administration's intent to decouple the US-China economic relationship are a clear indicator of significant policy changes in Washington in line with the fact that the administration is no longer seeking outright confrontation with Beijing.  Throughout his remarks, Pence praised Trump's policies toward the world's second-largest economy, which he expects will ultimately benefit both countries. At a delicate moment in the ongoing China-US trade negotiations, Pence unleashed some positive signals by stating the US' readiness and willingness to seek dialogue and cooperation with Beijing. He has effectively left the door open for constructive dialogue to end the trade war and establish a new course for stability, and affirmed the idea that stable China-US trade ties agreed through negotiations are possible and acceptable. The speech followed China's constructive steps to pass new laws that deepen its financial market openness, improve its business environment and protect the intellectual property rights of foreign businesses - all concerns raised by Trump's administration. As substantial progress has been made through protracted efforts by both countries during their phase one trade negotiations, Pence's remarks in this regard may help both sides come closer to forging an overdue trade agreement.There is an increasing possibility that the trade war could be phased out. Nevertheless, the areas of disagreement and contention illustrated by Pence's speech still cast a shadow over the path toward a trade deal, and remind us of the lurking perils. The author is a senior fellow at the International Cooperation Center (ICC) of the National Development and Reform Commission of China. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn
