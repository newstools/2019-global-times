But the Netherlands and other northern countries refused any transfer of wealth and worked successfully during almost two years of negotiations to gut the budget idea of its original intention.Instead, ministers decided on the details of something called a budgetary instrument that for now is limited to just 17 billion euros ($18.74 billion) over seven years and would be attached to the EU budget.Inspired by the bailout programs for Greece, Portugal and Ireland, the tool only helps governments that deliver politically difficult reforms, such as loosening hiring and firing rules, slashing pensions or privatising state companies.France is holding out hope eurozone members will be allowed to increase the pot either through national contributions from member states that so wish, or through external resources, such as a special tax.For now, the debate is kicked over to the thorny EU budget negotiations, where all the 27 member states, including non-euro nations, will have to agree to see a slice of bloc-wide spending go to a eurozone pet project.Those negotiations are already tense with the departure of net contributor Britain, putting pressure on rich countries to fork out more cash to the EU budget, or see coveted European programs slashed.Macron's budget dream "crashed in the desert of eurozone nonsense a while ago and attempts to rescue the remains get increasingly desperate," said analyst Lucas Guttenberg of the Delors Institute in Berlin."In the end, it's pretty clear now that some member states just don't want a meaningful fiscal instrument. That is the reality."
