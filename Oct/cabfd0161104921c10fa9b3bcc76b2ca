They need to integrate with the people for better serving the latter timely," Zhi said. Analysts stressed that the move as necessary considering the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which would probably bring about more migrants: an inevitable tendency as the industrial level and public services in the province keep developing.  Guangdong, one of the most populous provinces in China, has 113.46 million residents in 2018, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Of that population, about 40 million were floating laborers, media reported.Meanwhile, the province has 2,434 police stations with about 54,000 police officers and 95,000 auxiliary police, according to the China Police Daily.In the past five years, police stations dealt with nearly 120 million alerts, solved 3 million criminal and 5 million public security cases, according to the report.According to the newly issued guideline, a 24-hour-self-service zone will be established at local police stations, aiming for a better service in minor cases, such as torts and lost property. The provincial public security department also initiated a three-year-project in May to establish 180 police stations and repair 362 in underdeveloped regions, the China Police Daily said.
