The SAMR will also initiate a defect investigation based on the accident probe and risk assessment, and issue a risk warning if necessary.Compared with internal combustion cars, NEVs are new and it's common for consumers to have concerns about the sector due to recent reports that some cars spontaneously ignited, said Wu Shuocheng, a Shanghai-based independent analyst.In April, a Tesla Model S self-ignited in Shanghai. The US-based  carmaker's response was that a battery had short-circuited.In June, Chinese electric carmaker NIO recalled nearly 5,000 ES8 electric sport utility vehicles for "spontaneous combustion" battery risk.Wu told the Global Times on Wednesday that "the rules will help ease consumers' concerns and secure sound development of the industry, since the growth of NEVs is the future."If companies make a late or fraudulent report, or don't make any report at all, the SAMR will make a public notification or impose penalties according to relevant laws and regulations.
