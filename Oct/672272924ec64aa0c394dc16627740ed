The company has also established a database for more than 5,000 traditional embroidery patterns. More than 10 "embroidery dreams" tourism routes to the villages where this craft originated were established to show the beauty of traditional Chinese craftsmanship. Pan Yuzhen, a 74-year-old Miao embroiderer from the deep mountains of Guizhou Province, said that this was her second time in London. "I have been to many places in the world that I never imagined I'd visit. Now my whole family lives a much better life through our embroidery skills and by our own hands," Pan noted.After 16 years, the Embroidery Dreams Project has enabled more than 10,000 seamstresses to say goodbye to poverty through their hard work.Barbara Judge, who founded the B&H project with Xia in 2016, told the Global Times that the past three years have been a magical experience for her. The B&H project is a creative platform that allows young UK designers and traditional Chinese handicraft workers to cooperate on new concepts of fashion."With the help and blessing of the Chinese ambassador here, we get closer and closer as nations," Judge said. "The UK and China relationship is a partnership that I hope will go on forever. And today is a very important part of that partnership."Newspaper headline: Cultural empowerment
