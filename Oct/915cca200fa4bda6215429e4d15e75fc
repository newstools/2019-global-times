(Xinhua/Pang Xinglei)Â Chinese authorities will try harder to enhance social care and public service for senior people, said Vice Premier Sun Chunlan Tuesday. Efforts will be made to meet the essential needs of the elderly in basic old-age care, medical treatment and nursing services so that senior citizens in need will not be left out in the country's drive to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020, Sun said at an awareness event a day after the Chongyang Festival, equivalent to China's Seniors' Day. Better nursing services and elderly-friendly facilities in communities, as well as comprehensive medical services, will be provided, she said, adding that resources from different sectors are welcome to help seniors live a more purposeful and dignified life.
