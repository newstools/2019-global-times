A pro-Brexit protester waves a Union flag as he stands with "We Voted Leave" placards outside the Houses of Parliament in London on September 9, 2019. Photo: AFPA Dutch beach party billed as a "symbolic chance to wave good-bye to Britain" as London battles to leave the European Union, has suffered its own postponement, organizers announced Saturday.Thousands of people have already signed up for festivities at the seaside resort of Wijk aan Zee near Amsterdam scheduled for October 31, the current deadline for Britain to leave the EU.But organizers said they had to postpone the event, set to feature bands and food trucks serving European specialties like Dutch chips, French wine and German beer."The idea of organizing such a fun, large event within two-and-half months turned out to be a bit ambitious," organizer Ron Toekook said."It wasn't possible in such a short period to complete the financing needed, partly because companies' sponsorship budgets are depleted by the end of the year," he said in a statement.The party is now planned for early 2020.
