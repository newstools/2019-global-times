"The US economy faces downward pressure, and Trump needs domestic support for his 2020 presidential election," he added."It's a good sign that the US has shown sincerity in trade talks, but given previous experience, it's possible the US may go back on its word," Li Yong, deputy chair of the expert committee of China Association of International Trade, told the Global Times.The trade conflict is a complicated long-term issue that can't be solved by one agreement, Huo said. "Since the beginning of the talk, China has been fully prepared for any possible outcome."The latest telephone conversation between the Chinese and the US side also echoed a plausible consensus on issues including the US import of Chinese poultry and China lifting a ban on poultry imports from the US.
