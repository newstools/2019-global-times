"The draft amends the weak parts of the existing regulations."The new regulations will place new restrictions on food delivery and courier companies, showing that disposable products have become a serious environmental issue in China, Liu said.Data analysis company Analysys International reported that China's takeout food market will reach revenues of 195.29 billion yuan, up 35 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2019. Environmental experts said it takes more than many years for plastics used for takeout food to break down in a landfill site. Beijing's move appears to be supported by most internet users, but many also question the government's ability to effectively enforce the new regulations."The move will also have a symbolic and guiding influence, which could enhance the civility of the city's residents," Liu said.
