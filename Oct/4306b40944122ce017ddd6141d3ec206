Investigators examine engine parts from the ill-fated Lion Air flight JT 610 at a port in Jakarta on Wednesday, after they were recovered from the bottom of the Java Sea. The jet that plunged into the sea on October 29 had an air speed indicator problem on its fatal flight and on three previous journeys.
