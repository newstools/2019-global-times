Global renewable energy capacity is set to rise by 50 percent in five years' time, driven by solar photovoltaic (PV) installations on homes, buildings and industry, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Qu Guoqiang, the manager of the center, said since the center was established in 2017 it has processed more than 1,500 tons of domestic garbage a day, generating 531 kWh of power for each ton of garbage processed. The remaining slag is turned into building materials including road slabs and bricks. At the start of July, mandatory garbage sorting began in Shanghai, China's economic powerhouse. The city's more than 26 million residents are now required to throw away garbage at a fixed time and place.

Policy and tariff reforms are needed to ensure solar PV growth is sustainable.
