Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said officers had wide powers to stop an attack, or even the threat of one."Any tactical option that currently exists, they can use, but additionally the policy says they can use lethal force," he told reporters in Melbourne.Though Patton said these were "extreme things to include in a policy," he said giving police clarity on exactly what actions they could take was "very important.""We don't want to wait until a car ploughs into a group of people, we want them to stop it before it occurs," he said.The announcement comes ahead of an inquiry into the deaths of six people killed when a driver mowed down shoppers in the heart of Melbourne in January 2017.It will examine whether police should have prevented the man from getting into the city center for the attack, which left 27 others injured.James Gargasoulas was jailed for life for the murders, which police determined were "not terror-related."The new hostile vehicle policy, which comes into force immediately, is the first of its kind in Australia.
