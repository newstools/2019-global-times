"Facing toward the future, China will continue to play the role as a big country to shoulder responsibilities, make efforts as the contributor of cyberspace development, promoter of cyberspace openness, defender of cyberspace safety as well as constructor of international cyberspace governance," said Huang."Today, cybersecurity has become more and more important. As President Xi said, it requires more international cooperation by dialogue. This is particularly important for one reason: Technology has clearly become more complex and requires more discussion but at the end it's possible to find solution," Luigi Gambardella, founder and president of ChinaEU Association for Digital, told the Global Times on Sunday.In recent years, China has participated in international cyberspace governance, made efforts to promote international cooperation and pushed for more equity. While on the other hand, China is confronted with a more complex situation. Some countries are using IT and its relevant products as a means to suppress and contain other countries, exacerbating the threat of confrontation in cyberspace, according to the China Internet Development Report 2019 released by Chinese Academy of Cyberspace Studies on Sunday in Wuzhen.Philippe Lin, president and chief representative of Eutelsat China Region, told the Global Times on the sidelines of the conference that he appreciates the concept of jointly building up the internet sector as the conference has expressed. "There are vast maritime and space areas in China that are not connected to the internet where satellite can help fulfill the digital gap and I see a broad space for China-EU cooperation on that front to further improve the country's internet infrastructure," Lin said.Digital futureThe tremendous progress of China's internet sector in the past more than two decades has greatly boosted the nation's digital economy and will embrace a prosperous future spurred by high technologies such as 5G, AI and IoT while more attention will be paid to data privacy and cyber security.By June, the country had 854 million internet users, more than the entire population of Europe, up 25.98 million compared with the level at the end of last year, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. According to the China Internet Development Report 2019, the scale of China's digital economy reached 31.3 trillion yuan ($4.42 trillion) in 2018, accounting for 34.8 percent of the nation's total GDP.Amid the uncertainties of global economic growth, digitalization has grown into a major economic driver. Newspaper headline: Shared future in cyberspace
