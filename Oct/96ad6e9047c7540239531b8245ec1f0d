Your daughter couldn't be with you this year to taste your dishes, hear your chat, touch your wrinkles, kiss your smiling face and accept your scolding," she wrote in the note, posted along with a picture of herself with a tracking device on her ankle, according to Huawei's online community Xinsheng Shequ.

You must pay me back one by one when I come back!" she continued. Meng's lawyers were in the British Columbia Supreme Court in early October arguing for the disclosure of documents in her case. Extradition hearings for Meng are scheduled to begin in January, and she is free on bail and living in her home in Vancouver, according to Canadian media outlet The Star. Meng was arrested in December 1 last year while traveling from Hong Kong to Mexico via Canada. She posted a $7.5 million bail 10 days later.
