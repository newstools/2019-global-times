Iranian students take part in a rally marking the 37th anniversary of taking over the US embassy by a group of Iranian students in Tehran, capital of Iran, on Nov. 3, 2016. (Xinhua/Ahmad Halabisaz)Â US President Donald Trump's recent threat of a possible military attack on Iran is only a "bluff," Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Thursday.The threat seems more like a "bluff to cover their chagrin" for their failed policies, Hatami was quoted as saying by the Press TV.On Monday, Trump said that if Iran does something, they will be hit as they have never been hit before.The Iranian minister warned the US against making the mistake of taking measures against Iran."If they make a mistake, they will receive a response that will make them more ashamed than the previous measures which brought about humiliation to them," Hatami said.The Iranian armed forces stand fully ready to protect the nation and the country's borders, and will give "a crushing response" to any threats or excessive demands, he added.
