As impacted by the riots, HK risks a technical recession and needs economic boosters."The city still has some resilience," said Jeff Zhang, a Hong Kong-based financial industry practitioner.Yang said the HK government will overcome the difficulties and help the city return to the right track.Yang also noted the city will introduce digital identification for residents to provide one-stop digital public services next year. Fifth-generation technology will also arrive in 2020 according to the earliest timetable.On Sunday, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po wrote in an article the city's government is mulling a third round of economic support measures. The city announced a HK$19.1 billion ($2.4 billion) economic support package in August. It is also rolling out measures to shore up support for its small- and medium-sized enterprises.Liang Haiming of the Belt and Road Institute at Hainan University told the Global Times on Sunday the digital bank roll-out will be the future and could become a growth pillar for the global financial hub. Massive job opportunities will be offered directly or indirectly through the digital banks, fostering the employment rate, Liang said.
