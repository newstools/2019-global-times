Among them were plans to remove foreign ownership limits on brokerages, fund management firms and futures firms in 2020, one year ahead of the original schedule.The limit removals will boost the country's equities market, Wu said. CSRC has long been advocating for more medium- to long-term funds into the market. To this end, securities and fund firms have moved toward being more long-term earnings oriented, and mutual funds have been pushed to be included in tax-deferred commercial pension investment schemes, Wu explained.Aside from the drive in the home market, the scrapping of foreign ownership limits will surely help channel long-term international funds into China's capital market, she added.Futures shares on the Chinese mainland market closed up 1.77 percent on Friday, while securities stocks ended 1.71 percent higher, according to data from online financial information provider Hithink Flush Information Network.By comparison, the flagship Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.88 percent to close at 2,973.66 points.
