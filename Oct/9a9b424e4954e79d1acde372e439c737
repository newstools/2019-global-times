On Saturday, CCTV invited Li Gang, the test pilot who flew the first J-20, to discuss his experiences with the aircraft."The J-20 used to be mysterious, and official sources seldom released any information," Fu Qianshao, a Chinese air defense expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday, noting that its frequent public appearances in October shows the Air Force is increasingly confident in its capabilities and is combat-ready, and Chinese pilots have mastered the use of the plane.China was the fastest in the world to take a fifth generation fighter jet to the operational level, even faster than the US with its F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets, Fu said.The J-20 made its first test flight in 2011, its public debut at Airshow China 2016 and entered military service in 2017.More Chinese combat units will gradually get the J-20, and the plane is also expected to get upgrades in engine, avionics and weapons, Fu said.
