An anonymous cultural relics expert told Shanghai-based thepaper.cn that the listed items are "ridiculously fake," and are mediocre replicas.None of the exhibits in the museum were marked as being replicas or reproductions, Jiang told the Global Times on Tuesday.The collections were donated by Wu Yingqi, a retired professor with the university and also a seasoned collector. Wu donated 342 items, including Chinese bronzes, pottery items, china and jade to the museum in February, according to the university's website. Wu Xiaoni, daughter of Wu Yingqi, was quoted by thepaper.cn on Tuesday afternoon as saying that the items had been identified by the school before being handed over to the museum. Wu Xiaoni also said the authenticity of the collections is subject to school investigation.As an important carrier of cultural inheritance, the items in the university museum could not only enrich the university's cultural background but also further promote students' cultural awareness and confidence, said the university.But Jiang said the exhibition showed the university and the museum experts were not being responsible toward history, the public and younger generations.Yuan Yinlong, a Henan-based coin collector, told the Global Times that both the donor and the museum side should have conducted an identity test on the collections before creating the exhibition.Yuan also urged collector associations and cultural relics bureaus across the country to jointly establish identification organizations for cultural relics and works of art.
