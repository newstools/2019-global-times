Meanwhile, the nation will unswervingly promote opening-up in various fields to cultivate a sound business environment."Some Chinese companies and products that are heavily reliant on exports to the US may be affected by the US Entity List. But overall, [the list] will not harm the fundamentals of China's technological development," Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) spokesperson Huang Libin told a press conference on Tuesday in Beijing.Huang added that short-term volatility affecting some Chinese technology companies will not affect the upward trend of China's technological development.Under the guise of trade tensions, the US blocked the exports of high technologies to China, but "we are confident that China's science and technology sectors can break the development bottleneck," said Huang.Recently, the US Department of Commerce added 28 Chinese entities including Hikvision and iFlytek Co to its Entity List, its latest move to contain China's technological development. The US move prevents the Chinese entities from buying US products. Huawei, as one of the world's largest telecom equipment suppliers, was put on the US Entity List in May, which blocked it from buying certain products from US companies. However, the company has accelerated its pace of development of proprietary technologies.Huawei released its much-anticipated operating system (OS) HarmonyOS in August amid the US ban. Huawei executives said that the groundbreaking move, considered Plan B that the company has long prepared, could be used at any time if Huawei is no longer able to access Google's Android OS. Ren Zhengfei, Huawei's founder and CEO, said in a recent interview that he was not worried about the US Entity List being a threat to the company's survival. Huawei is prepared for the list not to be withdrawn for a long time.  "It's not only Chinese enterprises ... all related companies across the world have been adjusting their operating strategies including seeking alternative materials, and the effect of the US crackdown will keep diminishing," Mei Xinyu, a research fellow at the Ministry of Commerce's Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times.China is considering its own unreliable entity list, which will be released soon, according to the Ministry of Commerce. But unlike the US, China is prudently assessing the comprehensive impact, and it will try to minimize the negative effects, experts said.The MIIT will cooperate with relevant departments to boost the establishment of an ecosystem that promotes industry collaboration and innovation. "We will firmly expand opening-up and treat China-US trade conflicts with an open and inclusive attitude," Huang continued.China will not develop behind closed doors, will not blindly pursue self-reliance and will not decouple itself from international industrial development, he noted, adding that China will further open up its telecommunications, internet and automobile sectors, while also stepping up intellectual property rights protection and improving its business climate.To keep opening up and improving the business environment is also an essential measure to help Chinese companies get through the trade war, Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a think tank, told the Global Times.China's countermeasures against Washington's crackdown and support measures for Chinese companies will be rolled out, Gao noted.Fostering a fair business environment is a long-term policy that will be implemented continuously regardless of external influences, Gao said.
