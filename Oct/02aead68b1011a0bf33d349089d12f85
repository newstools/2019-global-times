File Photo: VCGHong Kong activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung was barred from running in Hong Kong district council election on Tuesday as his nomination was ruled to be invalid. Hong Kong government said in a press release on Tuesday that it "supports the making of decisions on the validity of nomination by the Returning Officers in accordance with the law.""The candidate cannot possibly comply with the requirements of the relevant electoral laws, since advocating or promoting 'self-determination' is contrary to the content of the declaration that the law requires a candidate to make to uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the HKSAR," the statement said."Self-determination" or changing the HKSAR system by supporting the independence of Hong Kong as an option for self-determination is inconsistent with the constitutional and legal status of the HKSAR as stipulated in the Basic Law, as well as the established basic policies of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong, the statement read. Wong is a student leader of the Occupy Central Movement in 2014. He was arrested in August for allegedly inciting others to participate in unapproved assemblies and violently besieging police headquarters in June.
