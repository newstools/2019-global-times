Among them, the only selection from the Chinese mainland was Half-Hundred Mirrors, which made use of 3D immersive virtual reality technology to transport viewers in a world where oil paintings come to life. Directed by Yu Hong, an artist and a college professor from the Department of Oil Painting at the Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), Half-Hundred Mirrors presents a storyline inspired by his 32 oil paintings that follow a woman's life from her birth in the 1960s through childhood and eventually her adult life in today's society."We named it Half-Hundred Mirrors because the film tells the story of a girl's life in the past half century. It conveyed the theme that how individual growth has been affected by the tide of the times and development of our society," Han Dong, director of Technology Development for the film and an associate professor in College of Intelligence and Computing of Tianjin University, told the Global Times on Thursday. The film took Han's team half a year to finish, during which time they employed advanced technologies including digital collecting, computer graphic (CG) modeling, a VR engine, and human-computer interaction (HCI). Maintaining the original characteristics and even the brush strokes in the paintings, the film tells its story using 3D models accompanied by animation, visual and sound effects in a luminous environment, transforming the static paintings into a VR film that is immersive and interactive. It is an innovative way to integrate art and VR technology, according to Han."One of the difficulties in creating the film was that we needed to make a precise plan for the entire content and repeatedly evaluate the user's experience through feedback because the essence of a VR film is that it is an interactive experience, and cannot be finished by only solving the technical side of things," Han said. In a VR movie, a three-dimensional environment is generated using a computer and sensor technology. By donning a VR helmet, viewers can take a 360-degree look around as they "walk into" the movie scene. As internet speed gets faster and VR hardware becomes more universal, greater progress will be made to make VR film become truly immersive viewing experiences, Han noted.Han said that VR movies are an important trend in the future development of the film industry and that major film companies have begun paying attention to the field. This is sure to usher in rapid development after the gradual formation of a commercial profit model, coupled with the help of 5G transmission."Half-Hundred Mirrors being shortlisted at BIFF shows that China's VR movie creation stands neck and neck with the industries of major developed countries. It is an inspiration to us and we are more confident than ever that we will be able to push the field further," Han said, adding that as the technology used in Chinese VR movies continues to develop, Chinese VR movies should try to tell stories from China and demonstrate the Chinese spirit.Newspaper headline: Springing to life
