It's about making it fun and easy for our guests to enjoy their time with family and friends. Our partnership with Alibaba will help us do exactly that. Together, we can take the theme park experience to a new level."Universal Beijing Resort is expected to open in 2021. It will be the fifth Universal Studios-branded theme park in the world.
