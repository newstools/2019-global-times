One of the most well-known New Age musicians in China, Yanni has been gathering a huge fan base in the country ever since his historical performance at the Forbidden City in 1997. Many Chinese music lovers were amazed by his creative music style of blending jazz, classical, soft rock and world music, which inspired them to learn more about the New Age genre. The positive feedback from the Chinese market encouraged Yanni and his team, leading them to return time and time again. The Shanghai leg on November 13, which is just one day before the musician's 65th birthday, will be a special one. According to the organizers, the musician has arranged a playlist that mixes old and new works as well as Chinese elements so that Chinese audiences can experience the familiar along with the fresh new. China has been a continual source of inspiration for Yanni. "Nightingale," one of his most well-known works, was inspired by the Chinese flute. The list of his West-meets-East works also includes "Tribute," "Deliverance," "Love Is All," "Renegade" and "Prelude." The playlist for his China tour includes "Santorini," "Keys To Imagination" and "Within Attraction."
