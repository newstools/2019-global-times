Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks to mental health professionals during a visit to Watford General Hospital in Watford, north of London, on Monday. Johnson warned he will not delay Brexit beyond October 31, saying his latest proposals are a last chance to reach a deal, a Downing Street spokesman said on Sunday.

"We live in an increasingly protectionist world and it is vitally important - now more than ever - that Britain and other WTO members fly the flag for free trade," she said. Her comments came as Brexit talks between Britain and the EU teetered on the brink of collapse just three weeks ahead of the deadline for finding a deal for an orderly departure.Truss insisted in her address that Britain's exit from the bloc would be beneficial to the country, and also for the international trading system, which currently finds itself under attack."We will use our newfound freedom to champion free, fair, rules-based international trade with the WTO at its ­center," she said.The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said Wednesday a deal on Britain's withdrawal from the bloc was "very difficult but possible" to achieve before next week's crunch EU summit."I think a deal is possible and very difficult but possible," Barnier told Britain's Sky News television, confirming that he will meet his UK counterpart Stephen Barclay on Thursday. "The EU will remain calm, vigilant, respectful and constructive."
