It revealed that 52 percent of interviewees were affected by the social atmosphere in various degrees, including one in 10 couples saying they would postpone or cancel their weddings.Other impacts include late deposit payment to wedding service providers and additional wedding expenses, as some interviewees expressed concerns over transportation and safety of guests on their wedding day.Casey Chow, marketing manager of ESDlife, was cited by Xinhua as saying that some couples had to re-print their invitations postponing their wedding, while others arranged shuttle vehicles for guests as the metro service was impacted."These are all the main causes of rising wedding costs," said Chow.From August to September, ESDlife interviewed 1,297 Hong Kong residents who are planning to get married between 2019 and 2021, with the aim of learning the average cost of a wedding in Hong Kong, Xinhua reported.The results showed that the average cost of a wedding in 2019 was HK$369,166 ($47,091), up 2 percent from 2018. Wedding banquets were the most costly part of a wedding averaging HK$185,389, up 4 percent from 2018. Rings and jewelry, cost an average of HK$72,328 per couple; HK$38,680 was the average cost of a honeymoon; and wedding photography cost an average of HK$24,147.According to statistics provided by the Hong Kong government, there were about 49,300 marriages in the city in 2018, down 5 percent year-on-year. Global Times Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Rose queensPG&E blackouts reveal mismanaged concern over public safetyGirls three times more likely to be victims of cyberbullying
