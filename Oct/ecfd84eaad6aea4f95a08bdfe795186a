Queloz also works at the University of Cambridge in Britain. The Swiss pair hailed their win as "simply extraordinary."The prize consists of a gold medal, a diploma and the sum of 9 million Swedish kronor ($914,000).The trio will receive the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.In 2018, the honor went to Arthur Ashkin of the US, Gerard Mourou of France and Donna Strickland of the US for laser inventions used for advanced precision instruments in corrective eye surgery and in industry.
