Following the last 20 years' development, more than one million electric appliances are exported to Africa from its headquarters in Guangdong every year, according to company information Galanz sent to the Global Times.Jean Tabaro, chief editor of Rwanda's Kigali Today Ltd, told the Global Times that he chose Galanz microwave for his kitchen, due to its design, affordability and high performance. "You can see Galanz sold in supermarkets in our country, and many restaurants use Galanz microwave ovens in Rwanda."Sifiso Mahlangu, head of politics at South Africa's Independent Media, told the Global Times that he wants to buy a blender and toaster for his family as gifts. "They will be so happy to have them."An electric parts factory of Galanz's microwave oven is equipped with highly automated assembly lines, and an assembly line is only supervised by one worker. Edmund Smith-Asante, a reporter of Ghana's Daily Graphic asked Liang whether Chinese enterprises can help African countries realize automation as the African continent is in the middle of industrialization.Concerning industrialization, Liang suggested African governments and relevant departments organize their entrepreneurs to visit other countries such as China, which achieved rapid economic development through reform and opening-up, and to learn from their experience in industrialization and chalk out development plan according to the condition of each nation. "In the meantime, I hope African countries can improve people's education level and its support with infrastructure facilities," Liang added. "Only with sound education and proper infrastructure can the potential of Africa be achieved in a stronger and faster manner," Liang noted.
