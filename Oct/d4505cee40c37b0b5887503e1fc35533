Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui was also present during the presser and took questions from journalists. Xi's informal meeting with Modi at the coastal city of Chennai is slated on Friday. This informal summit is expected to have a significant impact on the bilateral ties of India and China, and it is a continuation of the 2018 Wuhan meeting, said Luo.Noting that in the current scenario of international affairs when protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise, Luo said both China and India are putting efforts for their own reforms. He added that free trade and economic globalization are developing under difficulties, so the cooperation and communication between the two largest developing nations are important.  Xi and Modi had an informal meeting in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, on April 27-28, 2018, which greatly fixed the bilateral ties after the Doklam standoff. Xi said at the meeting that mutual trust is the basis for the stable development of China-India relations. When asked whether China and India will ink any deals, Luo said that China and India will not rule out any possibility of cooperation in any region of the world.Answering the question about India's alleged ongoing military exercise at the China-India border and if that will impact the bilateral ties of the two nations, he said the report is not true so China has nothing to worry about.
