Not only Chan but his family has also been pondering the matter for quite a long time," Koon told the Global Time in an exclusive interview on Tuesday.The HKSAR government early on Wednesday issued a statement in response to Taiwan's statement on Tuesday that it wanted to send officers to Hong Kong to escort Chan to Taiwan upon his release from prison, saying that the HKSAR government sees the case as cross-jurisdiction law enforcement, and Taiwan's request is disrespectful of Hong Kong's jurisdictional powers and is totally unacceptable.The HKSAR government strongly objects to the Taiwan side's irresponsible allegation that Chan's decision to surrender was a result of political maneuvering, the statement said. "The homicide case took place in Taiwan. The body of the deceased, key witnesses and relevant evidence are all in Taiwan. Without doubt, Taiwan has jurisdiction over this offence. Now that Chan is willing to surrender, Taiwan should receive him, and initiate interrogation, evidence gathering and prosecute him," read the statement. Commenting on the HKSAR statement, the Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Council" released a notice on its website on Wednesday, warning that if the HKSAR government ignores the request from the Taiwan side, it will be responsible for whatever terrible consequence that occur.Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung urged on Tuesday that the Taiwan authorities should not put politics over justice and the Taiwan side should take over Chan, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Global Times
