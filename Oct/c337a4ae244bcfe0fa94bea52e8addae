The event was attended by government representatives, diplomats, media, and guests from China, the Czech Republic and its other neighboring countries in Europe. In the welcome speech, the Czech Ambassador to China Vladimír Tomšík reviewed the history of the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent state and how the two countries later divided and dwelled peacefully. The ambassador also highlighted the China-Czech relations and his expectation for stronger ties. "Throughout the 70 years of our relations pivoted around Czech and Chinese pioneers who — disregarded the geographical distance between our nations — wanted to create new bonds and new ways of cooperation in business, art or tourism, the seven decades of the partnership have been full of success," Tomšík said. "My goal is to create more opportunities and work on delivering an 'all-weather' political dialogue that will allow us to keep diplomatic channels open despite road bumps along the way." The handover ceremony of Skoda's new car to the embassy was also held.
