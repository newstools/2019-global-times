Increasingly popular raw meat meals for dogs and cats may be full of multi-drug resistant bacteria, posing a serious risk to animals and humans, scientists reported on Wednesday.

The competition was held on Saturday, during which pet dogs showcased vehicle-style costumes and competed in a race.

Paleo-like diets are said to boost canine vitality and immunity, even if there is scant research to back up such claims.Indeed, veterinary medical associations in the United States and Canada have raised concerns about raw meat pet food, with reports showing it to be a source of Salmonella and infectious yersiniosis in dogs. And that, Nuesch-Inderbinen told AFP, is a problem for humans."Raw meat-based diets may be contaminated with bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, including those categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as critically important for human medicine," she wrote by email."There is growing evidence that these pathogens pose a risk of infectious disease to humans not only during handling of feed, but also through the contamination of household surfaces and through close contact to the dogs and their feces."There are an estimated 140 million dogs and cats in the European Union, and at least as many in North America.More generally, antibiotic resistance has became a major health crisis across the globe."The situation with multi-drug resistant bacteria has spiralled out of control in recent years," said co-author Roger Stephan, a professor at the University of Zurich's Institue for Food Safety and Hygiene.
