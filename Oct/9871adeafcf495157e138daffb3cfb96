Dunn's father told Sky News television that the family were "disgusted" and "appalled" at the suspect's behavior. "I'm angry that someone could do this and then get on a plane and go," he said.The parents met with US President Donald Trump last week, calling him warm and welcoming but criticizing the White House's attempts to engineer a snap meeting between them and Sacoolas.
