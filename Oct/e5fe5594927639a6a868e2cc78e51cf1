Others have given up fishing entirely, he said."We have witnessed decreased stocks, so fishermen are now going further, beyond the reefs they are used to, whereas 10 to 15 years ago they would just fish near the reefs," he said.Bett also noted that local fishermen using traditional methods and small wooden boats struggle to compete with foreign vessels that fish using more modern gear.Security questionsFunded by the EU and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Mvuvi card project originally launched in 2018, with a pilot phase that handed out 250 cards to fishermen on Kiwayu Island in Lamu County.Those cards were eventually canceled due to the discovery of security gaps in the system, explained Mathenge Ndungu, program manager of the Kiunga Youth Bunge Initiative (KYBI).The local civil society group is in charge of finding and registering fishermen for the card.The group is now working with the government to strengthen the security of participants' personal information and is in discussions over allocating space on the government's servers to store that database, Ndungu said.In the meantime, KYBI has registered 700 fishermen and hopes to issue them all with cards by the end of the month."We are targeting 1,000 fishermen to be issued with cards in the first phase," said Ndungu.The hope, he said, is that the Mvuvi card will succeed in protecting a fishing industry already severely stressed by the combination of climate change, poaching and mangrove loss.Ali Tewa, 34, who comes from Kiwayu, started fishing when he left school at 16 and remembers a time when the fish were plentiful in the waters around Lamu County."Back then, in the 1990s, you could go [out] for between half an hour and three hours to catch around 200 kilograms of fish," he said. "Now, you can go a whole day without catching any."Newspaper headline: Poacher pushback
