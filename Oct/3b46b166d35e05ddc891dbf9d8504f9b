"We need to design solutions that are science-driven, that address issues like climate mitigation, adaptation, and the massive economic shift.""Now more than ever, the United States and China need to partner to pave the way and advance solutions that address our wicked challenges," Overpeck said. "The planet is one thing we all have in common.""As global economic leaders, the sooner we accelerate our collaborations, the sooner we'll solve the problem," he added.Overpeck held that with challenges comes opportunity. "We can set the example for designing equitable and just solutions where the whole world benefits, where we position ourselves for this global transition, where we reinvent the environmental movement for the 21st century and beyond."The forum is launched based on the existing student education cooperation program UM has with China, and aims to further the dialogue and cooperation between scholars and policy makers, Xi Chuanwu, organizer of the forum and a professor of UM School of Public Health, told Xinhua.The friendship between UM and China has spanned more than a century. UM is actually one of the first group of U.S. universities admitting Chinese students in early 1900s."Today, the partnerships forged between the University of Michigan and China create greater global impact through cross-cultural innovation, only possible through this collaboration in cutting-edge academic programs, scientific research, and technological exploration," said Martin Philbert, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at UM.
