At present, most videos are in the 4K resolution."Currently, Japanese firms have more advantages in terms of coding and decoding technology and basic materials in realizing 8K. And we should beef up efforts on those areas," said Zhao, adding that China has cultivated its own advantages in panel and 5G technologies.Ant Financial, the financial affiliate with China's e-commerce giant Alibaba, launched its garbage recognition technologies during the expo.
