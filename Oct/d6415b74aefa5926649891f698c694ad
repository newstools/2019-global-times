Michoacan has been racked for years by violence by drug cartels, other criminal gangs and armed "self-defense" groups.A shootout between two armed groups on August 30 left nine people dead and 11 wounded in the town of Tepalcatepec, around 75 kilometers from Aguililla. Authorities also found 19 bodies on August 8 in the town of Uruapan, in central Michoacan - some dismembered, others hanging from a bridge. The state prosecutor blamed the incident on a turf war between rival drug gangs.
