Catalan regional police clash with separatist protesters during a counter-protest against a demonstration in support of Spanish police in Barcelona on Saturday. Monday will mark one year since a banned independence referendum in Catalonia which was met with a massive police crackdown, captured the world's attention and plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in decades.

When the same tactics used in Hong Kong, it's a 'pro-democracy' protest."Newspaper headline: Support for Hong Kong backfires on West
