Over the past 60 years, archaeologists have excavated over 10,000 items out of a total area of 40,000 square meters from the site. Zhao Haitao from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) Erlitou archaeological team, said that China's earliest palace complex, bronze ware workshop and urban road network were all found at the site. The museum has three display areas where visitors can experience and better understand the archaeological achievements of the Xia Dynasty, and probe into the history and culture of the Xia Dynasty via various kinds of projects, such as virtual reality, embossment and sand tables. Li Boqian, a professor with the School of Archaeology and Museology of Peking University, said the Erlitou Relic Museum presents daily utensils, manufacturing tools and decorations for visitors to understand the social development, history and culture of the Xia Dynasty.
