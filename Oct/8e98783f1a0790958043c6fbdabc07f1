"When the chief executive tries to solve economic problems, and especially when those violent radical protesters and rioters are losing support, the US moves to provide more support to anti-government forces by passing the act; otherwise, the turmoil would die out due the lack of impetus." Sources told the South China Morning Post that housing and social welfare initiatives were likely to be the key points of Lam's address, including a fresh push for a starter-home scheme she launched two years ago and a limited resumption of the Tenants Purchase Scheme to help public housing tenants own their homes.Experts said housing and social welfare issues are closely related to Hong Kong people's livelihood and affected the stability of society, so many Hong Kong residents have high expectations of the policy address despite the current turmoil. Rioters started to use knives and a home-made explosive device in their attacks on police officers during last weekend's illegal assembly, which further angered ordinary Hong Kong people.Passing such an act in October could also allow the US to meddle with the 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections on November 24, Tian noted.

"This could make law enforcement more difficult for the Hong Kong Police Force."Hong Kong's response The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Monday expressed regret over an assembly on the US bill on Hong Kong, and reiterated that foreign legislatures should not interfere in the internal affairs of the HKSAR, according to the Xinhua News Agency. A HKSAR government spokesman expressed regret over an assembly held in Hong Kong's Central area, which urged the US Congress to pass the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The spokesman pointed out that since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the HKSAR has been exercising "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy in strict compliance with the HKSAR Basic Law, and the "one country, two systems" principle has been fully and successfully implemented.Newspaper headline: US bill to sustain HK riots
