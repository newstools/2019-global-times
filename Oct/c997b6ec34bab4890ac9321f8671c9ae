Z-20 utility helicopters prepare to take off from an undisclosed location.

Song did not mention if a traditional flight control system is still installed as a backup on the Z-20.The Black Hawk, a US utility helicopter with which the Z-20 is often compared, also saw an experimental fly-by-wire retrofit in June, which enabled the chopper to become optionally piloted, according to a statement released in June on the website of Lockheed Martin, parent company of Black Hawk maker Sikorsky.Zhang Qiqi, another Z-20 pilot, told CCTV that as pilots of the army air assault force they need to not only fly helicopters, but also play the role of a commander, coordinating air and ground forces, giving proper guidance and making them cooperate.The easy-control fly-by-wire factor enables pilots to better take that role, the anonymous expert said.The Z-20 is a medium-lift utility helicopter that can adapt to different terrains and weather and can be used in missions including personnel and cargo transport, search and rescue, reconnaissance and anti-submarine operations, experts said.
