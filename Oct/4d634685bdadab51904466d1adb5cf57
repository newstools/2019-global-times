Rinne said he would discuss the situation with Barnier during the weekend.The Finnish government noted in the press release that the remarks given by Rinne represented the Finnish stand. Finland currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU.The phone conservation had originally been planned for Friday, but was not possible until on Saturday, Finnish media reported.
