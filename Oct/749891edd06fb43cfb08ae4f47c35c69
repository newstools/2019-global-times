He noted, however, the sector was still able to post growth in the first three quarters due to the generally stable growth of the domestic economy, the implementation of favorable policies and diversification efforts.US role diminishesAs the trade war bites, the US' importance to China as a trading partner has steadily declined.Trade with the US accounted for 12 percent of China's total foreign trade in the first half of the year, customs data showed. In 2017, the figure was 14.2 percent. The figure for the first three quarters was around 12 percent, according to the Global Times calculation.Tian Guangqiang, an assistant research fellow with the National Institute of International Strategy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that trade prospects between the world's two largest economies will depend on the outcome of a trade deal."If the US can strike a deal with China, its trade volume with China will improve and its status as China's third-largest trading partner will strengthen a great deal. If there is no deal, the US will cut imports from China further, but this will still be manageable for the Chinese side as diversification efforts are paying off," Tian told the Global Times on Monday.China's trade with countries and regions along the routes of the Belt and Road Initiative increased by 9.5 percent year-on-year in the first three quarters and trade with Africa grew 7.5 percent, customs data showed on Monday.Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Monday that if there is some sort of deal, exporters and importers in both countries may start contracts that can be completed within a short time period, as they are still concerned about the flip-flop tendency of Trump's policies."Those contracts that require a long time period will continue to be put on hold," Bai said."Due to the quality and complementary nature of China-US trade, China should seize any opportunity to improve it but at the same time prepare for any sudden changes in attitude by the US," noted Bai. "The structural issue of the trade balance is for the long term."Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said on Monday that China hopes the two sides can meet each other halfway and properly address each other's concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect, when asked about past flip-flops by the US side.Chinese stocks ended higher on Monday, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index up 1.15 percent to close at 3,007.88 points.Newspaper headline: Trade prospects likened to good weather
