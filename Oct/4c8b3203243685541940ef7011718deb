Photo: XinhuaPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed Israel's president on Monday that he could not form a new government ­following deadlocked September elections, making way for his opponent Benny Gantz to try.The decision was an important defeat for Netanyahu as he seeks to continue his tenure as Israel's longest-serving prime minister, but it does not mean the end of those efforts since he still has various cards to play.Gantz will also face long odds in forming a government, with many analysts predicting he too will fail to negotiate a unity coalition.In that case, President Reuven Rivlin could ask a majority of parliament members to agree on a candidate.Rivlin has vowed to do all he can to prevent yet another election - a third since April - but the possibility remains that the stalemate could eventually trigger it.Netanyahu has been battling the threat to his political survival on two fronts, also facing the possibility of corruption charges in the weeks ahead."A short time ago I informed the president that I was handing back my mandate to try to form a government," Netanyahu said in a video posted on his official Facebook page.The prime minister blamed Gantz for refusing to negotiate on Netanyahu's preferred terms.Rivlin said shortly afterward that he intended to ask ex-military chief Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White alliance, to try to form a government.Like Netanyahu, he will have 28 days to attempt to do so. Rivlin can take up to three days to hear out the parties elected to parliament before officially tasking Gantz, who had no political experience before mounting his challenge to the premier he once worked with as military chief of staff."The time of spin is over, and it is now time for action," Blue and White said in a statement."Blue and White is determined to form the liberal unity government, led by Benny Gantz, that the people of Israel voted for a month ago." By "liberal," it signaled it would seek to limit the influence of religious parties in forming a coalition.
