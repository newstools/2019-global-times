Some paranoid politicians in Washington seem to have found another target to vent their "China threat" hysteria on. This time, the victim is the short video app TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. 

US Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton last week formally requested US intelligence agencies to "conduct an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other China-based content platforms operating in the US." 
What's the beef? Simply put, TikTok is considered a potential counter-intelligence threat for being too popular, with more than 110 million downloads of the app in US.
But the allegations cited by the couple of US lawmakers are their wanton accusations of the so-called national security risks, which are actually untenable and groundless.
According to a statement issued by TikTok, the company is "not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government. TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future ... Our data centers are located entirely outside of China, and none of our data is subject to Chinese law."
As such, the delusional national security risks to US prove to be nothing but the Senators' "China threat" paranoia, which has apparently reached new heights.
