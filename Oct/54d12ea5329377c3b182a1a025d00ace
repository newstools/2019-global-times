They may not celebrate Mass, but they may preach, teach in the name of the Church, baptize and conduct wedding, wake and funeral services and even run a parish with the permission of a bishop.In his closing comments to the synod, Francis said, "We still have not grasped the significance of women in the Church."Scholars have debated the precise role of women deacons in the early Church.Some say they ministered only to ­other women, such as at immersion rites at baptism and to inspect the bodies of women in cases where Christian men were accused of domestic violence and brought before Church tribunals.Others believe women deacons in the early Church were fully ordained and on a par with the male deacons at the time. The Church did away with female deacons altogether in later centuries.Francis and his predecessors have ruled out allowing women to become priests.But advocates of women priests see a female deaconate might eventually make it easier for a future pope to study the possibility of women priests.
