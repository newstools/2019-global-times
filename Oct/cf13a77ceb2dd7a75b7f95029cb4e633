Many are hired by recruitment companies which specialize in Asian labor, whose number has exploded."At first we were solicited for small projects, but for the past three years the demand for workers for large projects has increased significantly," Corina Constantin, director of recruiter Multi Professional Solutions, tells AFP.According to a 2018 study by US-based ManpowerGroup, four out of five Romanian employers have difficulties in filling posts.With a total workforce of 5.1 million, the country - one of the poorest in Europe - lacks an estimated 300,000 workers, according to industry groups."All sectors are affected but things are particularly bad in industries, where there are strict deadlines and contracts to be respected throughout the year," Christian Parvan, vice president of the Association of Entrepreneurs, tells AFP.'Abusive behavior' Parvan says foreign workers get "treated well," and their employers try to integrate them into the conservative EU member state, which unlike many other European countries has not seen a surge of nationalist sentiment.Baluta, the Bucharest district mayor, says 500-odd Vietnamese employed in construction in his district receive the equivalent of 900 euros ($1,000) net per month, one third higher than the average salary in Romania.But trade unionist Dumitru Costin criticizes what he describes as "abusive behavior" by many employers, adding that the Asian workforce "is much, much cheaper than the local one."He says labor inspectors cannot check whether the "minimum standards" of conditions for workers are respected because it is impossible to communicate directly with the employees."When they have traveled thousands of miles to find a job, it is obvious that they will obey without flinching and work unpaid overtime for fear of being sent back to their country," says Costin, who heads SNB, one of the country's main trade union confederations.Across the border in Hungary, trade unionists make the same accusations.Employers "exploit the language barriers by faking even their working papers," says Pallagi, head of the construction workers' union.Zoltan Laszlo, head of the Metallurgical Trade Union, says Hungarian employees likewise are under pressure from their bosses who tell them they are "easily replaceable" by Ukrainians, Mongolians or Vietnamese. Newspaper headline: Workers in demand
