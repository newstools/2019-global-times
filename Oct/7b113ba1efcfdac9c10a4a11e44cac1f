Photo: ICPortugal's parliament has agreed to open an entrance to the benches for its only far-right lawmaker after rival politicians complained letting him through was too bothersome.Andre Ventura, the leader of the populist Chega (Enough) party, earlier won the far-right's first seat.He was allocated the right-most spot in a row behind a wooden balustrade at the Sao Bento Palace legislature, requiring him to walk past members of the right-wing CDS-PP party.However, they and other parties said that was inconvenient and would force them to get up for a political rival. "It's not a political question, it's a practical one," said CDS-PP lawmaker Telmo Correia.Eventually, parliament agreed an opening be made in the balustrade next to Ventura's seat, meaning he would have his own entrance.The decision still has to be approved by the cultural heritage authority because the building is a protected site.
