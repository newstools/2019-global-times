Want Want's logo File photo: ICGuangzhou Want Want Foods Ltd, a well-known food company based in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province, is reportedly being investigated after its involvement in a river pollution scandal that caused a mass death of fish and severely polluted rivers and air, amid an overall campaign to improve supervision on environmental protections across the country.The pollution was first discovered around the Xinyuan Bridge on the Yonghe River in Guangzhou on October 18, the local river chief office said on Sunday, according to a report from domestic news outlet Cover News on Sunday.After a preliminary probe, Guangzhou Want Want Food Ltd is under suspicion of discharging dangerous, strongly alkaline effluent into the river through the sewers in its plant. The water collected from the site was recorded at pH11, read the report.In a post on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo, thepaper.cn reported on Sunday that the pollution was caused by workers in the plant cleaning equipment with strong alkaline solutions, and allowing the polluted wastewater into the river.The polluted water poured into the river at an outlet at the Xinyuan Bridge, according to the report, citing a plant manager.Relevant local law enforcement departments have launched an investigation into the company for allegedly discharging wastewater, reported the Cover News.The company has not responded to the reports, and netizens are expressing their disappointment and hopes that companies can shoulder more responsibility for environment protection."The regulations on newly founded plants are currently restrictive; plants can't launch production without it being approved…but some plants established earlier may avail of loopholes…It's too irresponsible for society," posted a Sina Weibo user named Songshuyunwuxin on Sunday.China has been strengthening the monitoring of, and punishment for, environmental pollution. Companies' unregulated and illegal behaviors have been published on national or local platforms. In a list published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment on October 14, more than 50 companies were found to have problems in their treatment of solid waste and are now required to fix any issues within a specific time frame.The ministry also vowed to establish a strict regulation and supervision system to monitor and regulate the treatment of dangerous waste by the end of 2025, according to a notice published on gov.cn on Wednesday.
