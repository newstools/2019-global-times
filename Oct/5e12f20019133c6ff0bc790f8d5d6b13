It has already been granted a second season."The impact that digital streaming services are having on the television and entertainment industry cannot be overstated," the FilmLA report said. Witherspoon had already converted to television, appearing in an unprecedented ensemble cast for HBO's Big Little Lies opposite Streep, Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Zoe Kravitz.At the Los Angeles launch for The Morning Show, Witherspoon said she was also drawn to television because it offered more diverse opportunities, particularly for older actresses and minorities, than traditionally white, male-dominated Hollywood studios."The idea that streaming services actually have empirical data that audiences want to see people of different ages, different backgrounds... creates an opportunity for new voices to emerge and new storytellers to emerge," she said."So I'm enormously grateful to the streaming services - it's changed my entire career."Directors too are eyeing up television for new opportunities.Mann is working on a television series set during the Vietnam War. Steven Spielberg is writing a horror series for short-form streaming service Quibi, and bringing Masters of the Air - his second follow-up to Band of Brothers - to Apple's new platform.Ben Stiller - who has shot hit movies including Tropic Thunder, Zoolander and The Cable Guy - returned to his television roots this year behind the camera, directing Showtime's prison break drama Escape at Dannemora."I'd never done anything quite like this," he told journalists at a Los Angeles TV summit. "I knew I always wanted to do more serious stuff and work in different areas as a director.""Television has changed," he added.
