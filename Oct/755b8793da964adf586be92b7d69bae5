A series of contemporary sculptures are being exhibited at Beijing's Imperial Ancestral Temple, where ancient emperors used to pay tribute to their ancestors every year. The exhibition, which kicked off on Saturday, features 36 modern-day works of art by young Chinese artist Ren Zhe. This is the very first time that the 600-year-old royal garden has opened its gates to contemporary art. The exhibition includes the debut of Ren's new series of China's 12 zodiac animals. For the work, 12 steel soldiers armed with different weapons guard the royal garden as well as the other steel sculptures on display. "In the past, animal signs were used to represent us people," said the artist. "However, I do think we can speak for ourselves. So we can find elements of each zodiac sign in these sculptures." According to the curator Willam Fong, the new works mix the Chinese traditional calendar with a modern approach to art. Tradition is not completely absent from the exhibition. Other sculptures on display include historical figures such as Tang Dynasty (618-907) General Yuchi Jingde and General Guan Yu from the Three Kingdoms (220-280).
