Dog owners queue up with their dogs at an office in Xiacheng District of Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang Province to get dog ownership certificates. The city started the campaign on Thursday to reign in dog owners' behavior, stipulating that without a permit, owners could face fines as high as 5,000 yuan ($720) per pet.

Many people also don't want to pay, and it is difficult to reach a consensus," said Zhang Yiwu, a cultural expert from the Peking UniversityThe bureau explained in an attachment on its website that they launched the move because a large number of dogs were abandoned due to the growing population of dogs, and local authorities have received lots of complaints in recent years about citizens being annoyed or attacked by stray canines."Euthanizing unclaimed stray dogs is also being done in other parts of the world, including the US and Europe," Zhang stated.He noted that the government should focus more on supervising dog owners, such as feeding procedures, epidemic prevention, dog tracking and penalties for dog owners who abandon dogs. Many cities in China have promulgated pet dog regulations over concerns about the mess they make and reported accidents. Police in Ji'nan, East China's Shandong Province introduced a penalty point system for dog owners in 2017. The system states they need to attend classes to learn about regulations on dog management.
