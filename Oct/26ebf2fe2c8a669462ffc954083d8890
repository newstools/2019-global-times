Therefore it is already popular among Hong Kong residents, who can enjoy a cluster of favorable policies at the hospital from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority," Zhao told the Global Times on Monday.According to data Zhao provided to the Global Times on Monday, from 2010 to 2018, residents from Hong Kong, Macao and the island of Taiwan have had 1,155 organ transplant operations in the mainland, including 676 for Hong Kong residents.
