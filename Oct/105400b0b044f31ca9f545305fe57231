Zhou Tian(left) and Yu Long Photo: Courtesy of BMFChinese conductor Yu Long held a talk with young Chinese musicians Zhou Tian and Du Yun, both having gathered international fame with their unique styles, as part of the ongoing Beijing Music Festival (BMF). Growing up in China, both Zhou and Du now work and live overseas, which in their eyes is a sign that China's 2nd generation of musicians is introducing the country's culture to the world. "We work and live in other countries, but the Chinese element is still in your blood," Zhou commented.  In Du's eyes, traditional Chinese art has always fitted with the tastes of the world. Yu added that what Chinese artists need to do is inherit not just China's own culture, but the culture of the human race as a whole. Yu also called for more music and art festivals to provide more opportunities to young musicians and allow them to make mistakes.
