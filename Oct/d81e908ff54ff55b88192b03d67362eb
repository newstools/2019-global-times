The mainland used Macao's capital of $1.28 billion, up by 100.8 percent year-on-year.The government of Macao is also mulling efforts to strengthen economic ties with the mainland. The Monetary Authority of Macao said on October 13 that it had authorized global consultancies to conduct a feasibility study on setting up a yuan-denominated securities market in Macao and relevant work was being conducted in an orderly manner.This is in comparison with Hong Kong, which has been stuck in social unrest for months, with some Hong Kong-based rioters demanding "independence" using violent protest methods.But Liang said despite societal differences between Hong Kong and Macao, the Chinese government will roll out policies to support both cities. Hong Kong's role in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area won't dwindle in importance because of the unrest, he noted.
