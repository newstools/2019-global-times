It is hoped that related authorities can clarify such malicious rumors, he said.The Office of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong made no comment on the suspicion to Hong Kong-based online news portal HK01's inquiry on the reports. Nicholas Yang Wei-hsiung, Secretary for Innovation and Technology, said in an interview with the local business program that the replacement is a rumor and he will continue serving for the government. Previously in early September Reuters reported that Lam had said she would quit if she had a choice, a report that Lam immediately rejected.Lam said she had "never submitted a resignation to the central government" and that she was confident leading her team to "help Hong Kong walk out from this dilemma."Newspaper headline: Reports of HK chief’s replacement are ‘rumors’ Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US PG&E blackouts reveal mismanaged concern over public safetyGirls three times more likely to be victims of cyberbullying Great Pacific Airshow
