And teachers cannot punish students for such acts, the action plan said.In December 2018, the Ministry of Education published a notice to reduce students' burden, such as requiring schools to control the amount of homework and strictly managing after-school training institutions.Netizens consider Zhejiang's measures to control the homework time of students a one-size-fits-all approach. "Some children cannot concentrate on homework, so they finish it late," one Sina Weibo user said.Educational experts said they support the government's endeavor to reduce students' burden, but only when standards of the social evaluation system are changed. "If we always consider grades and rankings as only standards in the system, relevant policies cannot be put into practice," Xiong Bingqi, a deputy director of the Shanghai-based 21st Century Education Research Institute, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Another city, Nanjing in East China's Jiangsu Province, also sparked controversy over burden alleviation measures."No cram schools, no exams and no additional class exercises, it may not be long before your child becomes a relaxed, joyful and mentally healthy student with poor grades," a Nanjing citizen said in an online article, reflecting parents' concerns.A father in Nanjing with a sixth grader said that the city has implemented a new round of burden alleviation measures. "Homework is reduced," he said. "I want my child to be healthy and relaxed with less study tasks, but the reality is we must do more exercises to surpass others and enter great schools. You lessen the burden but others are still striving."
