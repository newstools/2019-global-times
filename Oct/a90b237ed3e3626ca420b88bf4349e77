Screenshot from Pear VideoA traditional snack nicknamed the "dirt bun," which is made of flour and cooked in heated sandy soil that is special to Jiyuan in Central China's Henan Province, celebrated its own festival on Saturday. Small balls made of flour, egg and sesame seeds are roasted in fine-grain soil. When they're done cooking they're simply scooped up, given a few taps to dust off the soil and eaten warm."I grew up eating the dirt bun and us locals have kept the tradition alive that's been around for more than a thousand years," Wang Shiping, a local chef who has been making dirt bun for decades, told Pear Video.   Wang says the local soil has no impurities."It smells really good and tastes crispy. I was really amazed by the way they cooked the dirt bun," a tourist surnamed Li told Pear Video. "The snack makes me homesick. Every time I leave my hometown I will bring some dirt buns with me," Liu, a local man who lives and works far from home, told Pear Video. Pear Video
