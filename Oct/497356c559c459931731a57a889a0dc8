The resident accused the show of "inciting hatred.""Half of the audiences are children," the resident was quoted as saying to the media. "I really don't know what kind of black humor the park has designed. I'm going to call for complaint but I think it wouldn't work well."Net users urged the park to "bring pure joy" to visitors and expressed fears that the show "could have a bad effect on young audiences." Lawrence Tang Fei, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, said that the Halloween show, originally designed to entertain children and families, "has been turned into a political show, a frivolous and unserious act that threatens to tear apart society and spoil the fun of families."The designer of the show "apparently intended to incite hatred as so many plots of the show made the audiences feel a political innuendo," Tang said.Program director and lead actor Sam Wong Cham-sum has allegedly received complaints and was suspended from the performance. The suspension and show adjustment "was nice but it would be better if they could check the script of the show beforehand," Tang said.A person who answered the phone of the Hong Kong Tourism Board hotline told the Global Times that the park continues to open as usual.The Global Times reporter found on the park's website that the show was scheduled to open to the general public on October 4, 11, 18-20, 24-27, 31. Five shows on Thursday had not been canceled as of press time.
