The material can be used for manufacturing light filaments and optical instruments.In China, exports of the three rare metals  - as well as some types of grain and gasoline - are subject to state trading management. Under this system, companies and traders that don't obtain approval can't engage in the export of relevant products.Newspaper headline: Nation releases new rules on management of rare metal exports
