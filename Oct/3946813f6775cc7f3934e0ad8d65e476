"Washington's policies are the main reason for the proliferation of terror outfits in the region," Rabiee said. He also said that al-Baghdadi's death is the end of a symbol of "destructive terrorism," however, his death cannot be interpreted as an end to the ideology of extremism, like IS. The US President Donald Trump announced Sunday morning in a televised address at the White House that the IS leader al-Baghdadi was killed by the US forces' raid on his compound in northern Syria.
