Additionally, she gave a presentation titled Music and The Mind at Yale Center Beijing that explored the power of music as it relates to "health, including childhood development, music therapy, and discoveries that are changing human beings' understanding of the brain."A total of 22 performances were held over the 25-day-long BMF.
