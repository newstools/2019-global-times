Photo: VCGChina will closely monitor the US Entity List and will take "all appropriate measures" to defend China's legitimate rights, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology spokesperson Huang Libin said at a press conference on Tuesday."Some Chinese companies and products that are heavily reliant on exports to the US may be impacted by the US Entity List. But overall, [the list] will not harm the fundamentals of China's technological development, and some Chinese technology companies' short-term fluctuations will not affect the upward trend of China's technological development," Huang said.Under the disguise of trade tensions, the US blocked the exports of high technologies to China, but "we are confident that China's science and technology sector can break the development bottleneck," said Huang.The ministry will cooperate with relevant departments to boost the establishment of an eco-system that promotes industry collaboration and innovation."We will firmly expand opening-up and treat China-US trade conflicts with an open and inclusive attitude," Huang continued.China will not develop behind closed doors, will not blindly pursue self-reliance and will not decouple itself from international industry development, he noted, adding that China will further open up its telecommunications, internet and automobile sectors, while also stepping up intellectual property protections and business environment improvement.China's fair internet infrastructure has fostered many great internet enterprises, such as Douyin, a famous Chinese short video app, which have been seeking overseas expansion and bringing their experiences to the world. This is in line with the globalization trend, Wen Ku, another spokesperson of the ministry, told the media.For Chinese enterprises going overseas, it is important to integrate into the world, to comply with local laws and regulations, and carry out healthy competition with their own resources and capabilities on the premise of operating legitimately, Wen noted.Recently, the US Department of Commerce added 28 Chinese entities to its Entity List in its latest move to contain China's technological development.
