Shipowners say they are trying to cut their heavy-polluting industry's impact on the environment by using cleaner energy - but some have stalled over limiting the speed of ships.

This compares with 2.0 percent for air transport, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization.The IMO has decided that from next year sulphur content in heavy fuel oil will be cut to 0.5 percent.This is expected to be achieved by the use of "scrubbers," or exhaust cleaning systems fitted to ships that reduce the amount of sulphur emitted into the environment.Meanwhile, a large section of the French maritime sector recently voted to limit pollution by reducing ships' speed, a move supported by President Emmanuel Macron.The ecological benefit is exponential:A tanker that lowers its speed from 22.2 to 20.4 kilometers per hour reduces its fuel consumption by 18 percent."Reducing vessel speed is one of the options on the table, but it's not the only one," said Hiroyuki Yamada, director of the marine division of the IMO."This measure is pushed by some shipowners but not by all," he added. "Our role is to put in place effective measures that can provide more flexibility."However, shipowners are yet to be convinced."It's first and foremost a question of investment," said Philippe Renaud at CMA CGM Group. "If we reduce speed, we will need more ships." And to add "a longer journey increases storage time and results in additional cost for customers," he noted.The issue of reducing speeds will feature at the 75th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee between November 11-15.The French maritime sector is hoping for a possible vote in favor of the measure in 2020, for implementation by 2023."The shipping industry has to address climate change," said Edmund Hughes, head of air pollution and energy efficiency at the IMO insisted last week."We have to phase out CO2 emissions as soon as possible," he insisted.Newspaper headline: Low speeds on the high seas
