"The US move to associate the company with the trade war between the world's two largest economies gave Huawei the most compelling advertisement, and there is also enhanced cohesion inside the company." "The financial results, which provide promising results, showed that the company has recovered from the initial impact brought of the US ban," Fu Liang, a Beijing-based telecom industry expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday."The negative was strongest in the second quarter. In the third quarter, what we saw was that the job of fixing holes in Huawei began to yield results," noted Fu.The company is expected to debut the smartphone version of the HarmonyOS on its flagship P40 smartphone, which is to be launched in early 2020.HiSilicon, the in-house semiconductor and integrated circuit design company operated by Huawei Technologies, said it has begun selling its 4G chip, the Balong 711, on the open market as demand for internet-backed solutions continues to surge.Newspaper headline: Huawei rebounds from US pressure
