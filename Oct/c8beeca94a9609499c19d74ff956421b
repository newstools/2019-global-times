The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress heard a report on a draft decision that will allow the State Council to temporarily adjust the implementation of laws regarding road traffic safety, foreign trade, fire prevention, food safety, customs, and seeds in pilot FTZs. The adjustments are expected to be carried out on a trial basis within three years to promote the reforms on separating permits from business licenses in the country's 18 pilot FTZs, which are likely to begin on Dec. 1. The draft decision aims to fully implement a list-based approach in managing all business operation approvals and will streamline administrative approval procedures to make it easier to start businesses in the pilot FTZs. The legislative session will run from Oct. 21 to 26.
