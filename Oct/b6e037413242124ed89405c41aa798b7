(Xinhua/Huang Jingwen)Â China-Mongolia relations are at their best moment in history, Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Xing Haiming said here on Wednesday. The two countries forged diplomatic relations exactly 70 years ago today. The Chinese ambassador described the 70th anniversary of bilateral ties as a "new starting point." He noted that the two countries should continue to strengthen their political mutual trust, deepen pragmatic cooperation, increase mutual understanding between both peoples and support each other in international and regional affairs. The Chinese ambassador expressed confidence that the two countries can achieve their goal of increasing bilateral trade to 10 billion US dollars by 2020. China has been Mongolia's biggest trading partner and top export market for many years. Bilateral trade surpassed eight billion dollars last year, edging closer to the 10-billion-dollar target set for 2020, according to the ambassador.
