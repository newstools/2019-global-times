Exit polls were expected by Sunday evening."Here's to this derby ending in Tunisia's favor," said Najoua Nahali, 53, holding up her ink-stained finger after voting in central Tunis. On Friday night, Karoui and law professor Kais Saied went head-to-head in a rare television debate, a last bid to woo voters. Karoui, a 56-year-old business tycoon, appeared relaxed, if at times hesitant. Speaking in Tunisian dialect, he stuck to his key themes of economic liberalization and fighting poverty.Serious but also at ease, 61-year-old independent candidate Saied called for the decentralisation of power and criticized the country's partisan system, in classical Arabic.The runoff outcome remains uncertain, with a ban on opinion polls, but Karoui received a boost with his newly formed party, Qalb Tounes [Heart of Tunis], coming second in legislative elections a week earlier.Saied topped the first round in the presidential election, held on September 15, with 18.4 percent of votes, while Karoui followed with 15.6 percent. Turnout for that round was a modest 45 percent. "Rendezvous with history," headlined Tunisia's La Presse newspaper on Sunday, while French language daily Le Temps said absent voters "will be in the wrong."
