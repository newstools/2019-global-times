He tweeted, "@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets… and we are NOT a political organization."However, the response did little to appease Chinese netizens. Some Weibo users said that Hong Kong affairs are a bottom line for all Chinese basketball fans, urging the club to punish Morey or fire him."No basketball team is bigger than my country. Morey must be punished. The Hong Kong Special Administration Region is a part of China," one Weibo user wrote.
