The daily fleet volume at the airport will reach 280, the CAAC said.The airport opened on September 25, a monumental moment that highlighted both the country's prowess in building a massive infrastructure and its ambition to further connect to the world as well as maintain its rising global status.The airport, which has four runways, parking spaces for 150 airplanes and a 700,000-square-meter terminal, is expected to handle 45 million passengers by 2021 and 72 million by 2025.
