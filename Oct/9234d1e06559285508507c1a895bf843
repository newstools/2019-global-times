"It needed an unprecedented team effort from our commercial partners, our friends across government and my colleagues at the CAA," he added.The regulator on Monday said it would now launch its largest-ever customer reimbursement program under the Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL) scheme.The scheme is a safety net, based on an EU directive and managed by the CAA, which covers tourists who have bought all-inclusive trips with flights and hotels."We know that customers are devastated by the cancellation of their holidays," Moriarty said. "Those who bought a Thomas Cook ATOL-protected holiday are entitled to a full refund of all the money they have paid towards the cost of their holiday."In addition to this, ATOL protected passengers that were abroad when the company went into liquidation might be able to claim for out of pocket expenses."Debt-plagued Thomas Cook, which struggled against fierce online competition for years and blamed Brexit uncertainty for a drop in bookings, declared bankruptcy on September 23 ­after failing to secure fresh funds.
