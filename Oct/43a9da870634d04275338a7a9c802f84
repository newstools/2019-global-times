The US has put Huawei on its Entity List in May and later granted a temporary reprieve in August, allowing US companies to work with it. The reprieve was extended to November. With regard to semiconductor growth, HiSilicon has already surpassed semiconductor maker MediaTek and become the largest chipset designer in Asia.HiSilicon has come up with various chipset products and solutions including Kunpeng, Ascend, Kirin and Balong, covering smartphone processors, artificial intelligence-powered technologies, servers and others.Faced with a complicated external environment, Huawei can only reduce the risk of core chip supply disruptions through more independent chip design and production, and gain more space for further growth, analysts said. In addition, Huawei has achieved major breakthroughs in power amplifiers - critical components for 5G products. PA chipset technologies are mainly owned by American companies. "This also showed it has increasingly reduced dependence on American components," Fang Jing, an industry analyst at China Merchants Securities, told the Global Times.
