A fighter with the Syrian Democratic Forces fires a mortar shell toward a part of Baghouz where remaining Islamic State (IS) group fighters are holding out in their last position, in the countryside of the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor on March 18. A shroud of black smoke covered the last redoubt as forces battled holdout jihadists.
