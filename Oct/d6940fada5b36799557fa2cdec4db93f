Screenshot from Sina WeiboWith a pen in hand diligently writing in his notebook, a schoolboy was seen doing his homework at superstar Jay Chou's concert on Saturday in Jinan, East China's Shandong Province.  A video of the boy squatting on the floor, while the legendary singer and musician sang his classic love songs has gone viral on Chinese social media.  The concert was part of Chou's 20th anniversary tour, which sold out 12 seconds after tickets went on sale online, Sina.com reported. Tickets cost between 500 and 2,000 yuan ($70 to $283), while scalpers were charging twice that. Some netizens confessed they were jealous of the boy, whose family must have purchased the expensive ticket only to have him ignore Chou's brilliant performance. "The most expensive homework ever," wrote a netizen.Others thought the boy's parents were fans of Chou, and forced their child to attend the concert. "Give me your ticket boy, I'll do all the homework for you!" another netizen wrote unfortunately after the fact, on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Global Times
