It was established by UN agencies in Iraq in cooperation with the Iraqi government to promote and protect the rights of all Iraq's people according to international standards.Since Tuesday, hundreds of Iraqis have been holding protests on the streets in Baghdad and other Iraqi provinces. They voiced their anger that two years after defeating the extremist Islamic State militants, millions of people are still living in worsening conditions in the oil-rich country.The protesters are demanding better living, job opportunities and basic services. They blame the deterioration on what they see widespread corruption and incompetence of the government.Early on Friday morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called on the protesters to calm down.In his televised speech, he said that "your demands for reforms and the fight against corruption have reached us," promising that his government would not make "empty promises."
