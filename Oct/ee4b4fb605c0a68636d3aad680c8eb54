In Hong Kong, only a small number of young people are willing to do research." Under the rules, the funding for R&D projects in Hong Kong and Macao are settled in yuan. For subsidies below 1 million yuan ($141,195), the funding will be paid in two stages, with 80 percent being paid in the first stage. For subsidies above 1 million yuan, the funding will be paid in line with the progress of projects.Hong Kong Secretary for Innovation and Technology Nicholas Yang Wei-hsiung said on Wednesday that his bureau plans to establish a third innovation platform, as the previous two InnoHK initiatives received desirable feedback.For the existing InnoHK initiatives focused on healthcare technology, artificial intelligence and robotics, the Innovation and Technology Bureau has received 65 applications, many from prestigious universities and research organizations, Yang said, according to an article posted on the Hong Kong government website.Liu said, "If Hong Kong cannot seize the opportunity and strengthen communications with the Chinese mainland in innovation and technology, it may even lose its original advantages."
