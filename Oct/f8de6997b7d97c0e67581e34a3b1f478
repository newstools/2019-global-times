They have been shut for eight working days out of safety concerns. Bankers and analysts also cited wide fears depositors will try to take out their savings when banks reopen.Schools and many businesses have also shut their doors. Protesters have blocked roads across the country for days.The protests, ignited in part by a government plan to tax WhatsApp calls, have swept Lebanon at a time of deep economic crisis. Efforts by the army to persuade protesters to unblock the roads have failed.Amid a sea of Lebanese flags and music blaring from loudspeakers, people joined hands along coastal roads on Sunday, aiming to span 171 kilometers from the south to the north."What's happening is proof of how peacefully we are protesting, when you see people all holding hands and having one heart," said Nadine Labaki, an Oscar-nominated Lebanese filmmaker taking part in the chain in Beirut. "Today is a fateful day."The size and geographic reach of the protests have been extraordinary in a country where political movements have long been divided along sectarian lines and struggle to draw nationwide appeal."We're here to show the whole world that we are united," said Rasha Hijazi, joining hands with others in the southern city of Sidon. "Everyone is coming to stay united against the corruption we are living with in this country."
