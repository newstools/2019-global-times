Both measures have been condemned by the UN previously."I encourage Australia to make greater use of human rights-compliant alternatives to detention, which are non-custodial and community-based," Bachelet said.Her comments came after conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week used a major foreign policy speech in Sydney to decry international institutions that he said "demand conformity rather than independent cooperation on global issues.""We should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community," he said."And worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy."Morrison went on to declare that the government "can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia."The comments have widely been interpreted as a swipe at the UN.Bachelet did not address the prime minister's statements directly, instead rebuking Australian commentators who suggest "the UN human rights machinery should focus its attention elsewhere." "This scrutiny is not the function of some international policing system enforcing rules from outside," she said."It is based on international standards that Australia has helped to create, which successive Australian governments have voluntarily adopted."Bachelet also called for comprehensive human rights protections in law.Newspaper headline: Rights chief takes swipe at country’s detention and refugee system
