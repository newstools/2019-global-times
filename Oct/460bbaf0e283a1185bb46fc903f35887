In a recent interview, Li told media that he had been forced out of the company by Yu.Dangdang began as an online bookstore and later developed into a comprehensive e-commerce platform. It went public in 2010 in New York, but the operation soon encountered hardship.Weibo users recalled the alleged prostitution case of Liu Qiangdong, founder of China's e-commerce giant JD.com. Users searched for illegality between the lines of accusations such as Li "accompanying" officials to entertainment venues or funding movies with actors related to government officials."It seems that Dangdang has won the warm-up battle before China's Double Eleven Shopping Festival," posted one net user, referring to the Chinese mainland November 11 singles shopping event.
