An excited Sanwo-Olu told an agreement signing ceremony gathering on Wednesday that the project would be a major milestone for infrastructure development in the state, adding that the signing had ended period of uncertainty that had trailed the delivery of the Lekki Seaport project. The completion of the project would invigorate the Lagos economy and push it up in the index of largest economies in the world, he said. "This is a new beginning for us in Lagos. We have achieved another milestone in our efforts to transform the state and accomplish the 21st century economy ambition," he added. The governor expects that the outcome will catalyze Lagos' economic growth. The 629 million dollars financing facility is to accelerate the completion of the Lekki Deep Seaport project, which started in 2011.
