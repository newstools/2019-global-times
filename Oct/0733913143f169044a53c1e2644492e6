According to a statement from the State Council Financial Stability and Development Commission, which was released by the central bank in July, China will further open its financial markets with 11 measures.It will also scrap foreign shareholding limits in securities, asset management and futures firms in 2020, a year ahead of schedule.  China's capital market had been grappling with bubbles, so the past strict regulation on financing overseas was intended to guard against financial risks associated with large inflows of "hot money", Cong explained. Regulators' ongoing deleveraging efforts have yielded positive results, which means that the country no longer needs such a rule to constrain foreign capital. "It's good timing," Cong added.
