Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the General Debate of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York, on Sept. 27, 2019. (Xinhua/Li Muzi) Pakistan on Saturday said it denied India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi permission to fly through its airspace due to "ongoing grave human rights violations" in India-controlled Kashmir.It is the third time in recent weeks that Islamabad has refused to allow Indian leaders to use its airspace.Requests by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind and Modi were turned down last month."Indian Prime Minister wanted to use our airspace but we denied permission in the perspective of black day being observed by Kashmiris today to condemn Indian occupation and ongoing grave human rights violations in Indian-­occupied Kashmir," Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in a statement.Qureshi did not disclose Modi's destination but a senior Pakistani official told AFP the Indian prime minister had sought permission to use ­Pakistan's airspace to travel to Saudi Arabia, where he is due to attend an investment summit.Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian traffic in February after a suicide bomb attack that killed dozens of Indian troops in Kashmir, ratcheted up tensions between the two neighbors and prompted aerial dogfights.It reopened its skies for all civilian traffic in July, ending months of restrictions that had affected major international routes.
