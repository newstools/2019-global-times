Spain, Belgium and Finland were also contacted with concerns."Italy's plan does not comply with the debt reduction benchmark in 2020," said a letter signed by EU economics affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici and commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis.Rome sent its budget on Wednesday hoping to get Brussels to agree to a deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP, which the EU said risked delaying the reduction of Rome's massive debt mountain.The spending plans were the product of fraught negotiations between the new coalition in Italy, an unlikely partnership between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party."We will provide all clarifications to the EU, we are not concerned," said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. France's government unveiled a draft 2020 budget last month with more than 9 billion euros ($10 billion) in tax cuts for households in its bid to move on from "yellow vest" protests while still cutting the deficit. But the EU warned that these plans were "not in line" with commitments made to Brussels, and risked a "significant deviation" from the European rulebook on budgets.
