A bowl of Lanzhou hand-pulled noodles is served at a Mazilu Beef Noodles restaurant in Tokyo, Japan on August 14, 2017. Photo: ICThe manager of a beef noodle shop was astonished after receiving a million yuan ($141,532) on the second day in business, as a guest accidentally input an extra four "zeros" after one hundred, the actual cost of his noodles.  "We were startled by the number. My husband and I counted it many times, and we are sure that it is impossible to make such a big mistake," Chen Ruoxuan, owner of the beef noodle shop in Shaoxing, East China's Zhejiang Province, told Knews. Chen said a guest and his three friends spent 85 yuan in total on their meal, and also registered for a membership of the restaurant, which costs 100 yuan.After realizing the mistake, the restaurant owners immediately contacted the guests and gave them a refund, according to reports from Knews, which didn't report which payment platform had allowed such a large sum to be paid without first receiving confirmation for the client.Many netizens didn't quite believe the story, considering the key bit of missing information, and that payment platforms have strict limits on the size of instant payments.  "How's that possible! I am clear about every penny I spend," said a netizen on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo."My bank balance doesn't allow me to make such a mistake," said another Weibo user. Knews
