This greatly shortened the rifle's development period, according to CCTV.China's guns have been ranked among the world's most popular guns as China's gun development capability grew, CCTV said.Wei said China's guns are very competitive on the international market. Older generations of guns still have huge international demand because they are cheaper and perform very well, while new and advanced guns can also compete in high-end markets, he said.Accompanying the new rifle is an individual soldier combat system, which integrates dozens of advanced devices, including an information exchange interface packed up on the chest of a soldier, the CCTV report said."We will provide the Chinese warriors with our advanced equipment, making them super soldiers on the future battlefield," He Long, deputy head of the No. 208 Research Institute, told CCTV.Wei said the individual soldier combat system can greatly increase the battlefield situational awareness of soldiers by sharing information, so the battlefield would become more transparent to them as they can recognize danger and more accurately attack targets, gaining a significant advantage.
