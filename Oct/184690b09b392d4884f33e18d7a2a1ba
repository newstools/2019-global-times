Non-­smokers, too, never use liquid e-cigarettes from now," Park said.Park said the government would speed up its own studies to determine if there was a scientific basis to ban sales of liquid e-cigarettes, which vaporize liquid containing nicotine.A rival technology, which heats but does not burn tobacco, has been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has avoided much of the recent global regulatory crackdown.­South Korea's health ministry vowed to tighten regulations on vaping products such as strengthening customs procedures for imported liquid of e-­cigarettes.The South Korean office of US e-­cigarette maker Juul Labs said in a statement their products had no harmful substances. Juul, 35 percent owned by Altria Group Inc, began selling its devices in South Korea in May.Since smoking was banned indoors at places like restaurants and cafés in 2015, South Korea has become less tolerant of smokers. But e-cigarettes have  gained popularity in the country's $16 billion tobacco market since 2017.E-cigarettes accounted for 13 percent of South Korea's tobacco market by sales as of June, according to government data.
