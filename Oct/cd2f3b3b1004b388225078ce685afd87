An online celebrity with 277,000 followers doesn't realize her superimposed disguise has disappeared from the screen, revealing her to have a face not nearly like the princess her fans assume her to be.

It's disgusting," said Zhou, who lasted just 20 days on the job. Zhou said his job was to use his keyboard to entice men into spending more money than they intended to on online games produced by the company based in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province. His basic pay was 3,000 yuan ($424.7), but he could earn much more in commission that ranged from 6 to 15 percent of sales. "If a guest requests a voice chat, there are female employees to help me out and continue the swindle," Zhou said. "Some lonely men become overly generous when they think they're chatting with a beautiful woman and start imagining they're in a romantic relationship," said an industry insider. "I have encountered such situations online. A 'lady' even offered to marry me if I spent more money on a game. To be honest, I did enjoy talking with them," a netizen said on Sina Weibo.Global Times
