A red arowana that costs over 100,000 yuan ($141,55) at an aquarium market in Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. Photo: ICA poor man with the expensive tastes of a gastronome who should have known better, has been arrested for stealing two high-priced red arowanas from an aquarium and turning them into fresh sushi.Police say the two fish were worth 40,000 yuan ($5,662) each before the thief sliced them up and ate at least part of them. "I think the taste didn't meet his expectations as he only ate a small part of the fish. The rest of the fish is still in his refrigerator," Wang Ke, a local police officer of Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region told Knews, which posted a video report online.  A surveillance video shows the accused thief, surnamed Liao, went out for a casual midnight stroll when suddenly he pulls out a fishing net to catch the two ornamental fish from an aquarium in front of a store. He quickly puts them into a plastic bag and leaves.Liao rents a small room and only has a part-time job, said police, noting that despite his low living standards, he still has a taste for expensive cuisine."He should go to the zoo and try what tiger meat tastes like," said a netizen on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo.Knews
