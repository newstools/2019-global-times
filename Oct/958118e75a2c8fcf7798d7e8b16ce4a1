The location is the hometown of Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The IBN, a government body focused on promoting large scale investment, approved Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of 586 million US dollar from the Chinese company in August. "This investment is for the first phase of the works under which industrial park will be developed in 484.81 hectares of land out of planned development in 1,600 hectares," Zhou said.

"This will also help Nepal to utilize the economic opportunity offered by the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
