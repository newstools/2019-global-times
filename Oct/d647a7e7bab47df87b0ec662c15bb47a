Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks to mental health professionals during a visit to Watford General Hospital in Watford, north of London, on October 7. Johnson warned he will not delay Brexit beyond October 31, saying his latest proposals are a last chance to reach a deal, a Downing Street spokesman said.

Let me add also that it is high time to turn good intentions into legal text."After weeks of gloom and growing fears Britain would crash out of the bloc with no divorce arrangements in place, the last few days have given a glimmer of hope that an agreement can be reached - though there has so far been no decisive breakthrough.More than three years after Britain's 2016 referendum vote to leave, talks remain stuck on how to avoid customs checks on the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.The EU has reservations about London's proposed customs arrangements and the role for Northern Ireland's Stormont assembly in giving consent to the plans. London's Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay will join Barnier in Luxembourg later in the morning in what is being seen as a positive sign for progress in the talks - which have been shrouded in secrecy since the weekend as the two sides seek to avoid potentially damaging leaks."It's not done yet but we're trying. The British want a deal and they have moved on customs and Stormont," a senior European diplomat told AFP.
