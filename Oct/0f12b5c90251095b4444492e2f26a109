I'd never seen film of it before. I once read a scientific paper and thought: We must go and film that! But that was back in the 1960s and we couldn't get to China so in the end I dropped it… and then, blow me, this lot pop up and say 'we've got it.'"The new series aims to raise people's awareness of global climate changes and how human activity has impacted global wildlife and nature. "It is never too late to take action," said Alexander. "Seven billion people on the planet. If everyone is doing a little bit, we can make a difference."
