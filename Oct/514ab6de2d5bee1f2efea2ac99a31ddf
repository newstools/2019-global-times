"The butterflies in the story are a perfect symbol. A caterpillar must pass through the cocoon stage to become a butterfly. The wishes for the theater will be the same," he told qianlong.com. For 57-year-old Mao Weitao, the leading actress of the troupe and head of the theater, it is an 18-year-old's dream coming true. "Eighteen years later, Yue Opera finally has its own theater. In the future, we will not only stage Yue Opera performances, but also host international events to communicate with international operas," she said. "Butterfly also reminds us of Butterfly Effect. The theater can bring larger influences to the city and the country through the effect. Yue Opera is full of possibilities and brings us a large space of imagination." The season will also feature performances like Legend of Chunxiang, an adaption of a Korean love folk story, A World of Fickleness, Coriolanus and Du Liniang, a new work based on Shakespeare's Coriolanus and Chinese playwright Tang Xianzu's The Peony Garden.Global Times
