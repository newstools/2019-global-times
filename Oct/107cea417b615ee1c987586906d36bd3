Sharma Oli, who said his country firmly supports China in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity and stands firm in upholding the one-China policy.Nepal, added Oli, will never allow any force to use its territory for separatist activities against China.Dai Yonghong, a professor and academic member of the China Center of South Asia Studies at Sichuan University, told the Global Times on Sunday that such a strong and clear signal sent by the Chinese top leader is a stern warning to not only Tibetan separatists, but also other separatist forces in Xinjiang, Taiwan and Hong Kong.Given Nepal's special geostrategic position between China's Tibet Autonomous Region and India, the US-led West has been lobbying Nepal's certain forces to strengthen cooperation with the West so that the West can use Nepal as a lever in the US Indo-Pacific strategy, noted Dai.The remarks made by leaders of China and Nepal are also a strong warning to the West not to exploit Nepal's geostrategic importance, Dai added.Xi arrived in Kathmandu, capital of Nepal on Saturday afternoon from Chennai after an informal summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is the first state visit by a Chinese head of state to Nepal in 23 years.The Chinese president said he appreciated Nepal's firm adherence to the one-China policy, saying that China will as always support Nepal in safeguarding its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.

In 2018, trade between China and Nepal reached $1.1 billion, an increase of 11.7 percent year-on-year, according to media reports. Nepal's officials also refuted the so-called debt trap accusation over its participation in BRI.Kundan Aryal, press advisor to Prime Minister Oli, called the debt trap "propaganda" in an interview with the Global Times, saying that the "propaganda is not in place here in Nepal and we are not going to listen to propaganda like that."Some people were trying to provoke it, while all the parties here have reached a consensus that Nepal wants to benefit from the BRI and people hope that they can benefit from a big economic power, Aryal added.Act as a bridgeExperts noted China's cooperation with Nepal will contribute to the prosperity and stability of South Asia."To achieve its development goal, Nepal will need India's resources, but it will also need China. The BRI projects will be a historic development opportunity for Nepal, and the landlocked country could now link to the world through China's help," Long said.Long further noted that China's good economic relationship with Nepal will not hamper India's interests in Nepal, as China also supports Nepal to keep a good relationship with India, Long said, adding that India and China can participate in the China-Nepal cooperation as much as possible.In 2018, the leaders of China and India agreed to discuss the possibility of establishing a China-India-Nepal Economic Corridor to boost the development of the three countries.In the context of the improvement of China-India strategic mutual trust, Nepal, neighbor to the two most dynamic economic powers in the world, can completely transform its geopolitical disadvantages into geo-economic advantages, Chinese experts noted.Nepal can not only use the resources of China and India to promote its own economic development, but can act as a bridge between China and India, they said.
