They should also strengthen internal training and management to prevent similar mistakes, Yang said.Dior's revenue is expected to grow 18.7 percent this year to $6.96 billion, in part led by the explosive growth in China, media reports said, citing a report by Morgan Stanley.Newspaper headline: Dior’s map of China omits Taiwan, irritates net users
