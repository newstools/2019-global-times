Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen even expressed her support for Fu on her Facebook account.Foreign companies which enter the Chinese market should respect local consumers' sentiments, Shi Wenxue, a Beijing-based film critic, told the Global Times on Thursday.Maserati's move could be seen as catering to public opinion, Shi said.China has become the company's largest market worldwide, overtaking the US, in 2017. According to a March report by the Wall Street Journal, Maserati dealers in China have almost doubled to 96 in the past four years. However, China is no longer its largest market, as sales volume fell by more than half last year.Several other foreign companies including Swarovski, Versace and Givenchy have apologized on Chinese social media for mislabeling Chinese regions Hong Kong, Taiwan or Macao as countries on their products and websites, which quelled the anger of Chinese netizens and consumers.
