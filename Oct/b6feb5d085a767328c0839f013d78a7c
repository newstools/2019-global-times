Among them, 363,000 households are affected in Tianjin, 2.03 million in Hebei, 397,000 in Shanxi, 1.14 million in Shandong, and 1.31 million in Central China's Henan Province.The plan also called for an investigation of excessive discharges of motor vehicles, reducing road dust, supervising open burning and strengthening the construction of the automatic monitoring system for pollution sources."The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has been suffering from severe air pollution due to poor natural conditions, low vegetation coverage, dense population and industry, and the burning of coal," Zhang Yuanxun, an environmental science expert at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times."If the government eliminates polluting enterprises in a short period of time, it may result in a loss of income sources in poverty-stricken areas within the region," said Zhang.
