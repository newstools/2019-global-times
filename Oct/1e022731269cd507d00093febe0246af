We are a big enough country to run it without the convention centre," Peters told the New Zealand Herald."Auckland has got some alternatives. I don't want to jump in to say what they are, although some of them will be obvious as venues ... which are capable of the security and the least amount of interruption."When APEC was held in Papua New Guinea last year, cruise liners were used to accommodate delegates due to a shortage of hotel rooms in Port Moresby.Â The NZ$700 million ($450 million) centre, being built next to the distinctive SkyCity tower and casino complex, was New Zealand's largest construction site.
