The two countries are working towards expanding border ports, railway, road, aviation and telecommunications networks, according to the Chinese Embassy in Nepal.The China-Nepal cross-border land cable has successfully been put into commercial operation, the two sides have also reached initial agreement on issues such as increasing air routes between the two countries, according to the Embassy.Trade and investment, post-disaster reconstruction, energy and tourism will be the main sectors where the two might cooperate further in the future, and observers predict significant deals might be inked this time.Wu Lingcheng, a deputy director of Nepal office of Yunnan Provincial Energy Investment Group Co, who's now responsible for the Tamakoshi 3 Hydropower Station project in Kathmandu, told the Global Times that the energy sector could be a future focus of cooperation, and Xi's visit could accelerate the operation of a series of China-invested energy projects in Nepal, which has greatly benefited local people.The 200-MW hydropower project under the BRI, with a total investment of around $500 million, is expected to be started in early 2020 and will be completed in three-and-a-half years.During his Nepal visit in September, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed the importance of the trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity network, noting that the two should jointly promote the BRI and boost railway, road, air links as well as cooperation in border crossing, energy and cultural exchanges.China and Nepal signed a memorandum of understanding on bilateral cooperation within the framework of the BRI in May 2017."Nepal regards BRI as a new driving force for world economic growth and an open, inclusive, and viable platform for sustainable world economic cooperation through widest possible connectivity among nations and it is a boon for economic emancipation for economically deprived countries," Sundar Nath Bhattarai, founding president of the Association of Former Career Ambassadors of Nepal and founder member of China Study Center and Its Officiating Chairman, told the Global Times.Bhattarai said that Nepalese people have also been anticipating for a cross-border railway network between Nepal and China, a vision, if materialized, will bring about hitherto unparalleled transformation of the region between China, South-West Asia, Nepal, South Asia and also Central Asia.The cross-border railway will connect the Chinese border town of Gyirong, in Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region and Nepal's capital Kathmandu.A pre-feasibility study of the railway has already been conducted.
