The guideline, issued by the State Council General Office, demands measures taken to upgrade scenic sites' facilities and improve their services. It calls for efforts to lower tourism venue prices, develop more diverse cultural and tourism products, including various art performances and leisure agriculture. Tourism environment should be improved to better meet demands of overseas visitors, with efforts to provide overseas travelers with more attractive tour routes, art performances and specialty products, offer them more convenient mobile payment solutions and promote multilingual services, according to the guideline.
