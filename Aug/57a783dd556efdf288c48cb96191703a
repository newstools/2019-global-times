The government aims to stabilize supply of these items over the next five years.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who promotes rapprochement with the nuclear-armed North Korea, said that inter-Korean economic cooperation would allow South Korea to overcome Japan's lead. "Japan can never prevent our economy from making a leap forward," he said at a weekly meeting with senior presidential aides, adding that Japan will be a "catalyst" for South Korea's resolve to become an economic powerhouse.While foreign-branded cars make up a small portion of vehicle sales in South Korea, the business community is concerned a consumer swing away from Japanese imports for political reasons could grow in other sectors, such as tourism and retail.South Korea's Foreign Ministry on Monday began to send out travel advisory alert texts to South Koreans traveling to Japan, a ministry official told Reuters."The South Korean government has been closely monitoring the possibility of anti-Korean protests run by Japanese conservative groups, and we advise South Koreans visiting Japan to refrain from visiting anti-Korean protest sites and to be mindful of personal safety through safety text messages," said the official.Japan's Fast Retailing fashion brand Uniqlo has been a prime target for the boycott, with its 186 stores in South Korea making the country its second-biggest overseas market in terms of outlets.Fast Retailing Chief Financial Officer Takeshi Okazaki has acknowledged there had been some impact on its sales as a result of the campaign, without elaborating.Japan's Asahi Group Holdings said the boycott had hit its sales of beer, which is popular in South Korea, as it lowered its profit guidance slightly.Newspaper headline: Japanese car sales hit bump in SK
