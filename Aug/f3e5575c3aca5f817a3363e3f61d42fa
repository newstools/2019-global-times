Beijing plans to recruit a total of 100 inbound tourism partners globally in three years, said the municipal culture and tourism bureau Thursday. Beijing has so far recruited 60 partners. According to the bureau, 89 overseas tourism companies applied for the partnership and 30 were selected this year. The partnership program was launched in 2018, with an aim to develop Beijing's inbound tourism. The bureau has invited overseas tourism companies to submit promotional plans based on their local markets and tourists' preferences in order to better know the market's needs and make more targeted promotional plans. Exchange and cooperation activities have also been organized between tourism companies in Beijing and those in Belt and Road countries including the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Malaysia and Poland to introduce Beijing's tourism resources.
