The Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link will be the first express rail in China to be covered by 5G networks, Wei Ming, CEO of China Mobile's branch in South China's Guangdong Province, said on Wednesday. The network coverage of the express rail is part of the 5G industry development scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a scheme that was cemented on Wednesday with the establishment of the 5G industry union of the Greater Bay Area. According to Xiang Ligang, a veteran industry analyst, 5G will usher in a new era of economic growth and strengthen ties in the area, thanks to the mature industrial chain that already exists there."Shenzhen and Guangzhou are two of the most advanced cities in terms of 5G base station deployments and the deployment of 5G applications," Xiang told the Global Times."Most of the leading companies in the field of network and equipment production are gathered in the area, including Huawei and ZTE. Downstream applications companies, such as the drones and robotics company DJI are also headquartered there, making up one of the most mature 5G industry chains in the world," Xiang noted. As of the end of May, over 14,200 5G stations have been deployed in Guangdong, and the province is aiming to deploy a total of 60,000 base stations by the end of 2020, topping other provinces in China, according to a report by Southern Metropolis Daily. The 5G industry is expected to further strengthen the ties between Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, as 5G coverage will facilitate smoother communications and upgrade the manufacturing industry that can potentially provide more investment and job opportunities, Xiang said.According to Li Fandeng, director of China Mobile's branch in Hong Kong, by 2030, the 5G industry will directly give rise to 3 trillion yuan ($424 billion) of economic growth and 6.3 trillion yuan of economic value, creating around 8 million job opportunities.
