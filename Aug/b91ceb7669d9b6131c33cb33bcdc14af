They constantly threw objects at the shield-holding police forces, and attacked them with wooden sticks.To deal with such violence, the police fired tear gas and sent police dogs to assist. They used a newly developed cluster tear gas, which has wider coverage and stronger effect compared with traditional ones.The crowd also pushed blazing carts toward police, who immediately put out the fire with fire extinguishers. The drill was live broadcasted via many online media platforms. The crowds' outfits, equipment and the manner in which they attacked the police were very similar to those of the radical protesters in Hong Kong, which prompted many netizens to link it with the riots in Hong Kong.Many suggested that this could send a signal to those rioters, and called on Hong Kong police to learn from the drill. The live broadcast suffered from lagging streaming speeds from time to time as too many netizens were tuning in.
