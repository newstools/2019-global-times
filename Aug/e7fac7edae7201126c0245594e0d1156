China firmly opposes practices of the United States that undermine the interests of China and other countries with unilateral and protectionist policies, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Thursday. "China has noted that the US Department of Commerce added China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) and its three subsidiaries to the department's Entity List on Aug. 13," spokesperson Hua Chunying said in response to a question. By doing so, the United States has abused the concept of national security and the measure of export control and it hurts not only Chinese companies but also businesses of the US and beyond, said Hua, adding that China hopes the United States will properly judge the situation, stop its wrongdoing and stick to equal-footed consultation for a solution.
