This echoes the Hong Kong government's stance. This echoes the Hong Kong government's stance."One of the most important strengths [of Hong Kong] is the rule of law. That's why we have been doing so much to ensure that the rule of law is being upheld and respected in Hong Kong," Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Tuesday.The Office of the Commissioner added that the Sino-British Joint Declaration does not endow the UK any right to interfere in Hong Kong affairs. It is a bilateral treaty between China and the UK and no other country or organization can interfere in Hong Kong affairs in the name of the treaty.Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong and Hong Kong affairs are China's domestic affairs, said the Office of the Commissioner, adding that China strongly opposes to all attempts by certain countries to use the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and the well-being of the Special Administrative Region's 7 million residents as a bargaining chip.Global Times Newspaper headline: Pence’s remarks reveal ‘hegemony’
