China's first intelligent connected expressway in the eastern province of Shandong began automatic driving tests on Friday, according to Qilu Transportation Development Group. With three tunnels, three tollgates, a bridge and numerous longitudinal slopes that simulate real road situations, the 26-km-long test section perfectly meets test conditions. Testers demonstrated smart highway application scenarios such as road tests of intelligent connected vehicle platoons and running tests of intelligent roadside sensing units, such as laser and microwave radars, panoramic video surveillance, road sensors, as well as weather monitoring and intelligent traffic guidance signs. Zhao Xiangmo, vice president of Chang'an University and leading expert on traffic information engineering and control, said that as the next market with huge potential, autonomous driving will bring profound changes to the transport industry. The project, as planned, will become an international testing, research and development center for driverless vehicles by 2023.
