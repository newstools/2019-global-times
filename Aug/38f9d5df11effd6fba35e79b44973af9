I feel proud for China and want to learn more Chinese culture," he said, noting that he hoped Chinese Muslims would hold more events to show Chinese culture. The first batch of Chinese Muslims this year reached Mecca on July 15 from Southwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province. In 2018, nearly 12,000 people from China flew to Saudi Arabia for the annual hajj.
