"As many companies have built up industrial parks overseas, they need to import parts or materials needed for production from China," Chen said. "This has helped beef up China's exports, now facing protectionist headwinds."The promulgation of the initiative also become a bandwagon onto which central and western Chinese regions could jump, to develop trade with a new destination or produce exports unwanted by China's original trading partners, bringing them to the forefront of opening-up, experts said.  Beijing has achieved significant progress in pushing negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations over Friday and Saturday, a MOFCOM spokesperson said on Saturday.RCEP is a proposed free trade deal between ASEAN and its six trading partners including China.Foreign tradeAs the trade war between China and the US wages on, the progress of BRI has provided some cushions to companies caught up in the tariff battle."So far China has been able to effectively diversify its sources of supply for many agricultural and mineral commodities for which tariffs were imposed on US imports as these are relatively easily obtained from other nations worldwide," Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist with IHS Markit.As BRI is based on win-win, so it has immense potential for future growth, said Dong Dengxin, director of the Financial Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology."Because of the trade war, China will develop a closer and deeper economic relationship with more countries," Dong said.  "The Chinese approach of win-win, and its contribution to multilateralism will help the country win the respect of world countries and attain global leadership."To pursue connectivity between Europe and Asia, the EU and ASEAN agreed to upgrade their relations to a strategic partnership on Friday.Huang Ge also contributed to this story
