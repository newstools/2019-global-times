Di-Faced Tenner Photo: Xu Liuliu/GTA new exhibition featuring works by Marina Abramovic, Banksy and Yoko Ono kicked off at the CHAO Art Center in Beijing on Friday. The Ways of Seeing exhibition aims to present people with a different approach in appreciating art. According to curators Jonas Stampe and Xiao Ge in the exhibition's preface, art allows people to understand things in new ways, through metaphor and symbol, image and action. "When it speaks to us with poetry and vision about things that matter, Way of Seeing seeks to do just that," the preface said. In Bansky's 2004 work Di-Faced Tenner, visitors can see 10,000 copies of a 10 pound ($12) note in which Queen Elizabeth II's portrait has been replaced by one of Lady Diana, princess of Wales. Lady Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.The exhibition is scheduled to run until October 6.
