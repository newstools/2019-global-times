China on Thursday urgently summoned senior officials from the US Consulate General in Hong Kong and lodged stern representations over the contact between consulate officials and Hong Kong secessionist forces.Joshua Wong, who frequently collude with overseas anti-China forces to smear the image of the country and the city, admitted his interactions with officials from the US consulate general on Tuesday, Hong Kong-based newspaper Ta Kung Pao reported Thursday.The newspaper said Wong met with Julie Eadeh, political unit chief of the consulate general on Tuesday and discussed issues such as banning US exports of equipment to Hong Kong police. Officials from Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong have demanded the consulate general clarify the contact while expressing strong discontent and resolute opposition to the interference by the diplomat. The commissioner's office also urged officials from the US consulate general to draw a clear line with Hong Kong secessionist forces, stop sending wrong signals to the radical protesters indulged in violence and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs. "Do not go too far on the wrong path," it warned. Eadeh was involved in plotting subversive actions under the name of human rights and democracy while she was stationed in the Middle East as a US diplomat, said Ta Kung Pao.She has worked for the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which previously released the so-called human rights reports on China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
