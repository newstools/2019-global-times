China's UN envoy said Friday that in protecting children in armed conflict, the countries concerned should take up the primary responsibility and their leadership should be respected. Zhang Jun, Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations, lamented the grave casualties of children in armed conflict last year -- more than 12,000 killed and maimed, citing figures in a UN report. At a Security Council meeting, he said the international community should support the countries concerned to take up the primary responsibility for protecting children in armed conflict. The key to implementing the council's resolution on the protection of children lies in the efforts and cooperation of the governments concerned, he said. Therefore, the international community should respect the leadership of these countries, enhance dialogue and communication, and provide effective support and assistance in addressing difficulties, including financial and technical ones, he stressed. The latest UN report on children in armed conflict said the verified cases -- over 12,000 children killed and maimed in 2018 -- set a record. These casualties were among over 24,000 grave violations against children, up from 21,000 in 2017. Afghanistan, Palestine, Syria and Yemen topped the casualty list.
