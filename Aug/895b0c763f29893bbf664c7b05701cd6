Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Thursday that if the United States wants dialogue with Iran, it must return to the Iranian 2015 nuclear deal and remove its economic sanction against the Islamic republic, Iran's state TV reported. "The United States is engaged in an economic war against the Iranian people and it won't be possible for us to engage with the United States unless they stop imposing a war and economic terrorism against the Iranian people," Zarif told reporters in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Thursday. "If they want to come back into the room (of negotiations), there is a ticket that they need to purchase and that ticket is to observe the (nuclear) agreement," he said. US President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal last year and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran. The US administration demanded renewed talks on Iran's nuclear and missile program as well as the country's influence in the region, which has been rejected by Tehran.
