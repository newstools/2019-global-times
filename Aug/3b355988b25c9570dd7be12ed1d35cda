Namibia will host a first-of-its-kind a cappella music festival on August 31 to support the Buy-a-Brick Initiative and raise funds to address the housing needs of low-income communities.The festival was launched in Windhoek Tuesday by Standard Bank Namibia together with their host partners, including Vocal Motion Six (VM6), a Namibia-based a cappella group.Speaking at the launch, VM6 member Vasco Mandavela Mario said the festival will be supported by international acts like the Soweto Gospel Choir, The Soil (South Africa), Focus (Zimbabwe) as well as other Namibian vocal bands.Sindano Nekundi, Standard Bank's Marketing Manager of Corporate and Investment Banking, said the initiative is welcome as more than half a million of Namibians live in shacks."We also know that government alone can not address the housing needs and that is where we as citizens must play a complementary role," he added.The festival will be also used to provide supporters of a cappella and gospel music a platform to enjoy the music of their choice in a very family-friendly environment, he added.Meanwhile, all funds generated through the ticket sales of the festival will be distributed to the Shack Dwellers Federation of Namibia.The Buy-a-Brick housing initiative, launched in 2015 by Standard Bank and the Shack Dwellers Federation of Namibia, is aimed at mobilizing the private sector to aid in alleviating the housing shortage. The proceeds from the "bricks sale" are then used by the federation to build affordable houses for disadvantaged Namibians.
