The Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.1 percent, while the Shenzhen Component Index rose 2.96 percent. Shares of companies based in Shenzhen rallied on Monday, with 66 companies seeing an average gain of 5.6 percent.The soaring share prices reflected high hopes for the plan that it could unleash a new round of high-quality growth for both Shenzhen and the country as reform and opening-up policies did over the past four decades, said Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund Management Company. "There are huge expectations," Yang said.Hong Kong's roleGiven Shenzhen's proximity to Hong Kong, where violent protests have seriously damaged the city's global image, many have cast the plan as a way of replacing Hong Kong's role as a global financial center that the mainland's economy has been relying on for decades.Such views are part of efforts by some foreign media outlets that seek to pit Hong Kong society against the mainland and are short-sighted, Chinese mainland analysts pointed out."This is not aimed at pushing Hong Kong aside by any means," Cheng said. "If anything, this will help Hong Kong because it will bring many opportunities to Hong Kong firms and residents." Although the plan also offered favorable policies for Shenzhen's financial sector, including the yuan's internationalization and digital currency, it also called for financial cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao. The plan is intended to be conducive to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, which also aims to boost innovation and growth in the region.Some argued Shenzhen cannot replace Hong Kong as a financial center at least in the short term. In areas such as the yuan's offshore clearance, "Shenzhen will have a hard time catching up with Hong Kong," said an official in the cross-border financial sector who requested anonymity.Given the timing, as the city's global image has been seriously dented by violent protests, the plan also serves as a reminder that Hong Kong must end the violence and get back on the right track to focus on its long-term prosperity, the Chinese analysts said. "The door is open for Hong Kong, but it will be up to Hong Kong to seize the opportunity," Cheng said.Chen Qingqing contributed to the story
