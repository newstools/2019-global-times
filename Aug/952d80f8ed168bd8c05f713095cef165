Chinese animated film "Ne Zha" continued to dominate the Chinese mainland box office on Thursday, its seventh day of screening, the China Movie Data Information Network said Friday. The domestic full-length animated feature grossed nearly 172 million yuan (about 24.8 million US dollars) on Thursday. Its total box office reached nearly 1.47 billion yuan, becoming the highest-grossing domestic animated film. Telling the life tale of Nezha, a beloved Chinese mythical figure, the film features a daring overhaul of Nezha's appearance and depicts him more as a mischievous boy instead of the hero kid in previous cinematic works. The first Chinese feature film putting spotlight on firefighters, "The Bravest," ranked second in the daily box chart, generating 116.55 million yuan. Chinese family drama "Looking Up" came third, raking in 8.86 million yuan.
