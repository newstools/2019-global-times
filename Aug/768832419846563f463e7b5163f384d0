The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will bring fresh opportunities for young talents in Malaysia and China as the cooperation between the two countries continue to deepen, a Malaysian official said here Friday. Speaking at the Talent Endowment Forum and Fair, Malaysian Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Sim Tze Tzin said the fruitful cooperation and ever closer economic exchange have created plenty of job opportunities for students and graduates in both Malaysia and China, since the bilateral relationship was established 45 years ago. The implementation of the BRI and the greater bilateral cooperation will involve more versatile talents from the two countries, Sim said. The forum gathered some 30 companies including Chinese enterprises in Malaysia.
