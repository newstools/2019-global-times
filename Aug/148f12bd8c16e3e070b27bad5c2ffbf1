A foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday that any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs is doomed to fail. "Any attempt to undermine the 'one country, two systems' and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will surely be resolutely opposed by all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots," said spokesperson Hua Chunying. Hua's remarks came when responding to a query about two US senators' comments on the situation in Hong Kong. She said that the senators had failed to tell right from wrong and spoke nothing about the serious consequences of the radical, violent and illegal behaviors. Instead, they smeared the just actions taken by the Hong Kong police who have all along been professional, highly restrained and committed to safeguarding the rule of law and social order. The recent protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong have turned into radical violent acts that seriously violate the law, undermine security and social order in Hong Kong, and endanger local people's safety, property and normal life, she said. "No responsible government would turn a blind eye to such serious violent crimes," Hua stressed. The Chinese side once again urges the relevant American politicians to immediately stop condoning violent crimes and grossly interfering in Hong Kong affairs, she said.
