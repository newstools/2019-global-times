Finnish Minister for European Affairs Tytti Tuppurainen said on Thursday that Europeans "should have the patience" for a further delay of Brexit, if London asks for that. Tuppurainen also commented on the role of Finland as the rotating EU presidency. She said the room for Finland's maneuver is rather limited. Earlier this week, Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne said that, as an experienced trade union negotiator, he could think of something in helping finding solutions on Brexit. Rinne and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson are going to meet soon. Tuppurainen underlined on Thursday that Finland totally respects the mandate of the EU negotiator Michel Barnier. She said that Finland as the EU Council's president country looks for the good cooperation with Johnson. Tuppurainen appeared in a joint press conference with Amelie de Montchalin, French Minister for European Affairs. The French minister said France supports the aims of the Finnish presidency. Montchalin said that France does not want a hard Brexit, but rather an orderly solution. "But this would be a decision by Westminster and Downing Street, not a decision in the EU capitals."
