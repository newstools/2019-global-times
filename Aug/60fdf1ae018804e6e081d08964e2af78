The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in Hong Kong on Thursday condemned Canada's interference in Hong Kong affairs and urged Canada to stop pointing an accusing finger at China over its domestic issues.A spokesperson of the commissioner office said that Canada was mixing up right and wrong by justifying Hong Kong rioters' violent act as peaceful assembly. Canada also ignored Hong Kong police's rightful enforcement of law and instead called for restraint of all sides, the spokesperson said."Such remarks go against the demands of Hong Kong society and the public to stop violence and restore order, and actually defend the law-breaking rioters," the spokesperson said, adding that Hong Kong affairs are China's domestic affairs and relevant countries and politicians are urged to find their right position and stick to international law.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday called for restraint and respect for human rights as chaos triggered by months-long protests looms large over Hong Kong, Reuters reported. "We have emphasized the need to exercise restraint and reject violence. Now is the time to engage in dialogue and respect fundamental freedoms, including the right to peaceful assembly," Trudeau said. Trudeau's words came a few days after China issued a warning to Canada. On Sunday, Beijing warned Ottawa to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs after Canada and the European Union issued a joint statement in support of Hong Kong protesters' "fundamental right of assembly."Bilateral relations between China and Canada are experiencing a low ebb over the case of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver and faces extradition proceedings to the US. Trade ties are also taking a beating.Victor Gao, vice president of the Center for China & Globalization and who served as the China Policy Advisor at the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission in 1999 and 2000, told the Global Times on Thursday that Trudeau's remarks are hypocritical and manifestation of double standards."If Canada supports what is happening in Hong Kong involving violence and rioting, what would Canada do when people jeopardize law and order on its soil?" Gao said.Relations between China and Canada are supposed to be based on complementarity and mutual benefit, and Canada should find a breakthrough to mend ties with China considering the current political barriers between the two countries, noted Gao."However, Trudeau's misjudgment of the situation in Hong Kong will only worsen bilateral ties and does no good for the restoration of law and order in Hong Kong, which should be the current priority," Gao said.
