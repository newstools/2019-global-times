A low utilization rate means freight trains are carrying nearly empty containers.In some extreme cases, an entire train carrying 41 containers could have as many as 40 empty containers, according to media reports. Without directly refuting the report, the CRC said the issue of empty containers has indeed existed for some time as the CR Express service matured.The CR Express is also known as the "Belt and Road on rail," and by the end of June, the CR Express rail had connected 53 European cities across 16 European countries, with more than 16,000 cargo trains on the network transporting vehicles, laptops, food items, garments, and small commodities.
