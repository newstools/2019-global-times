We condemn violence and fully support the ambition to resolve the present situation peacefully,"Â an HSBC spokesperson told the Global Times on Thursday.However, the Financial Times reported that there was an internal memo sent to staff by HSBC on Thursday, saying that the bank would not issue an advertisement in English and "we are not changing our apolitical stance."The bank has helped lead US charges against Huawei, as it was attempting to convince the US Department of Justice to dismiss criminal charges for the bank's own misconduct involving US sanctions, Reuters reported in February.Dong Shaopeng, an advisor to the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told the Global Times on Thursday that statements condemning violence could not just be measures to ease the pressure of public opinion."Any internal version, such as a so-called apolitical stance or neutral stance, is unacceptable and should be condemned," Dong noted.Transnational companies should respect local countries' territorial integrity and sovereignty, which is a basic principle anywhere in the world, Dong said, adding that foreign companies' apolitical stances actually have a clear political bias that connives with rioters.Global Times
