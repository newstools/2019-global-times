China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) on Tuesday announced a decision to review anti-dumping duties on single-mode optical fibers from India which are due to expire. The review was made in response to applications by domestic producers who said harms on the local industry would continue should the duties be scrapped. The reinvestigation will start on Wednesday and end within a year. Single-mode optical fibers from India are subject to anti-dumping duties ranging from 7.4 percent to 30.6 percent, according to an MOC ruling on Aug. 13, 2014. Single-mode optical fibers are used to make telecommunications equipment.
