Mexico wants to become a "prosperous and productive environment" for digital innovation entrepreneurs, a Foreign Ministry official said on Thursday. Martha Delgado, the ministry's undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights, said the government believes new technologies can help promote economic equality. Delgado took part in the fifth edition of "Mexico Digital Economy," a forum that brings together entrepreneurs, developers, opinion leaders and scholars to discuss and analyze digital transformation. A key project of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's administration is to ensure all Mexicans have internet access as a way to promote economic development and bridge wealth gaps, the official said. "Mexico is very committed to digital innovation. We want to create the right conditions so that high-impact entrepreneurs find here -- in this country full of creative and innovative people -- a prosperous and productive environment for the development of their thinking and their initiatives," she said.
