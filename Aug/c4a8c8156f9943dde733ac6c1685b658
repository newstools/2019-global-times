The Hong Kong police warned on Friday that an interim injunction for Hong Kong International Airport has been extended by court and anyone in breach of the order is liable to the offense of contempt of court. The police noticed that some netizens were calling on people to deliberately use airport railway, airport bus, private cars and other means of transportation to and from the airport to disrupt the normal operation and traffic of the airport. "The police force must reiterate that the airport authority has just obtained a court order to extend the interim injunction until trial or further order of the court," Senior Superintendent Foo Yat-ting of Hong Kong Police Force's Kowloon East Region told a press briefing. The injunction order covers the whole airport island, Foo said, adding that blocking roads connecting to the airport may constitute acts of unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the airport. Any person who unlawfully or willfully obstructs or interferes with the normal operation of the airport, or who advocates or assists others in breaching the interim injunction, is liable to the offense of contempt of court, she said. "Hong Kong International Airport is an important transportation infrastructure. The acts of blocking roads connecting to the airport and obstructing the airport operation will inevitably have a great impact on the daily life of people here," Foo said, pointing out that the demonstrations over the past two months have affected people's daily life and livelihood, and caused strong opposition from various community groups and residents. "We'd like to appeal to members of the public - please adopt a peaceful and non-violence means of expression and respect others' rights and freedom," the police officer said.
