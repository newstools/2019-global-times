Huawei rejected Flex's accusation that the Chinese tech giant defaulted the US firm 100 million yuan ($14.19 million) due payment, a Huawei media affairs officer told the Global Times on Wednesday.The reply comes after an executive from US original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Flex Ltd, once Huawei's major smartphone assembler, alleged the company's decision to seize Huawei materials and goods worth 700 million yuan ($102 million) was based on the defaulting on Wednesday.An executive at one of Flex's plants in China, who declined to be named, told domestic news portal yicai.com on Wednesday that the seizure was based on the fact that Huawei owed the company due payments worth more than 100 million yuan.The response came after media reports emerged, revealing that Huawei is seeking compensation from Flex for illegally withholding its materials and goods worth 700 million yuan for two months in the wake of the US trade ban on Huawei, and that a lawyer's letter had been sent to Flex on Monday. The Global Times reported on July 25 that Flex was holding onto Huawei goods and materials. A Huawei media affairs officer told the Global Times on Wednesday that the claims are untrue, without providing further details.Ma Jihua, a Beijing-based independent telecommunications analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Flex has no reason to withhold property owned by its clients, and that Huawei stands a good chance of winning a lawsuit. "In the commercial world, sometimes a company will choose to withhold goods of its partner if the latter defaults on due payments," Ma said."However, such things would almost never to written into contracts, so if Huawei is suing Flex on this, the company stands a good chance to win," noted Ma.
