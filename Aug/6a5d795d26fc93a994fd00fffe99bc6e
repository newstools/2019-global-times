In Thailand, elephant-related entertainments serve as an important source of tourism revenue. Although elephant domestication has existed for centuries, controversies over abuses during elephant training and performance still occur from time to time.

Five of these Chinese companies also signed a wildlife-friendly tourism intent statement, the report said. Newspaper headline: More Chinese tourists to Thailand reject elephant rides
