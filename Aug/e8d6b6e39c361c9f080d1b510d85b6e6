Zhejiang is often hit by typhoons in the summer, but Lekima is among the three strongest to have hit the province in history, weather experts said."Lekima is like a horse with an extremely fierce temper. It rakes in so much water as it forms off the ocean. Sustained downpours pushed many rivers to very dangerous levels," said Luo Yuezhen, a top meteorologist with the Zhejiang weather service center.In Zhejiang alone, more than 21,000 service personnel and military members have been engaged in rescue and relief efforts. They stacked sandbags, drained muddy water off the streets and rode on inflatable boats to rescue residents of the 1,600-year-old city of Linhai, where streets were completely submerged on Saturday.Military rescue teams were called to Taizhou, Zhejiang, where a large part of the city suffered power cuts, tap water shortages and disruption of communication.A total of 650 firefighters, soldiers, policemen and government agency staff are searching for nine people who are still missing in Shanzao village in Yongjia county. By Sunday, 23 people in the village had been confirmed dead after torrential downpours caused a landslide, blocked a river and submerged many homes."I heard a loud bang at around 4 am Saturday, and I climbed up to check and saw the first floor was already full of water. The water rose to the fourth floor in less than 10 minutes," said Pan Jianli, a resident."I was waiting for death and was so lucky to have been saved, but it's saddening to learn that so many of my folks have died," said Pan.Xu Wenhai, a 59-year-old village official, was on his way back home when he saw his neighbor's family trying to wade through knee-deep water and escape a crumbling house. He helped the children escape but did not have time to save the mother.In Zhejiang, nearly 1.22 million people have been rescued from their homes, and about 5 million people were affected, said the provincial flood control headquarters.The typhoon damaged more than 189,000 hectares of crops and 36,000 houses, and the direct economic losses reached 16.6 billion yuan (about $2.3 billion), the office said.
