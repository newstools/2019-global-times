The economic and trade negotiation teams of China and the United States have maintained effective communication and are discussing to have a meeting in the United States in September, the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said Thursday. "It is of great importance right now to create the necessary conditions for the two sides to continue consultations," MOC spokesperson Gao Feng said at a press conference. If the Chinese team visits the United States for consultations next month, both sides should make joint efforts and create conditions to push for progress in their negotiations, Gao said. He said China is lodging solemn representations with the United States over the latter's decision to raise the additional tariffs on 550 billion US dollars worth of Chinese imports. "We hope the United States can meet China halfway and properly solve the economic and trade disputes between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect," Gao said.
