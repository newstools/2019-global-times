Thirteen people are dead and 16 others are missing as of 2 p.m. on Saturday due to a barrier lake burst as Typhoon Lekima swept through Zhejiang Province in eastern China, the local publicity department said. Typhoon-triggered heavy rainstorms hit the Yongjia County and caused a landslide that blocked the rivers with a maximum 10-m water level, trapping 120 villagers. More than 300 local armed police, public security officers and other social rescuers were dispatched to the scene. Rescue work is underway.
