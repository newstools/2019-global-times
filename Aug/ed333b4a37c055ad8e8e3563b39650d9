AVIC also developed another stealth drone, the Dark Sword, which is more similar to a fighter jet, according to foreign media.The Sky Hawk of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, the CH-7 of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation and the Sharp Sword of AVIC are also stealth drones.If a data link and control system can be developed between these drones and manned warplanes, they could become wingmen, the expert said.
