"We all remember the 9/11 attacks, right?"Its staff, contacted via telephone numbers and email addresses shown on the company's website, repeatedly told the Global Times that they are not in charge of responding to media enquiries and suggested that the Global Times ask the media or PR department.The situation has been repeated three times within a month.Cathay Pacific's PR department declined to comment when approached by the Global Times.Qi Qi, an independent market watcher, said if airports and airlines continue to indulge protesters, the local aviation industry is at great risk. "Once disorder becomes entrenched, consumers will definitely choose alternative airports." "Once disorder becomes entrenched, consumers will definitely choose alternative airports," Qi said. "The most direct impact will show up in employment."In 2018, passenger throughput at South China's Shenzhen Bao'an Airport rose 8.2 percent, and the growth rate at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport was 5.9 percent -- both higher than the 2 percent growth rate of Hong Kong Airport.If disruptions by protesters worsen in Hong Kong's aviation industry, competitors could easily fill any gaps, Qi said.
