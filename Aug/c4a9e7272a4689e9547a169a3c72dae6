The Work Safety Committee of the State Council summoned local officials and persons responsible for a deadly gas factory blast for inquiries Thursday. The blast, which occurred on July 19 in central China's Henan Province, killed 15 and heavily injured 16, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management. As the third extraordinarily serious accident occurring in the chemical industry this year, the local government and supervision regulators have not learned lessons from previous accidents nor attached enough attention to the requests of preventing risks, according to the meeting. The meeting demand the local government and emergency management departments to inspect on the root of the problems exposed in the blast and rectify carefully to defuse risks in the chemical industry. The local government and emergency management departments should also supervise and guide the enterprises to strengthen risk management, give warning education and intensify supervision over hazardous chemicals, said the meeting.
