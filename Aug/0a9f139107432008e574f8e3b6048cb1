I opened my cellphone and took a few pictures without paying much attention to the people next to me," the internet user was quoted as saying by Hong Kong-based pro-establishment newspaper. A few days later, when he looked at the photos on his phone, he found that Julie Eadeh was among them and Eadeh had met them before meeting Joshua Wong. Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao reported that Joshua Wong admitted meeting officials from the US consulate general on Tuesday. Wong frequently colludes with overseas anti-China forces to smear the image of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the pro-establishment newspaper said.China on Thursday urgently summoned senior officials from the US consulate general in Hong Kong and lodged stern representations over the contact. In a statement released Thursday, officials from Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong urged officials from the US consulate general to draw a clear line with Hong Kong secessionist forces, stop sending wrong signals to radical protesters indulging in violence and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs.
