The pills are later packaged, weighed and labeled automatically on the packaging line."The packaging line has been used in many large Chinese pharmaceutical factories to improve productivity, reduce contamination and slash human exertion," said Tu Hongsen, vice general manager of a subsidiary of HIT Robot Group.HIT Robot Group is one of the many Chinese robotics companies that have cashed in on China's huge demand for industrial robots, as the country aims to deploy a large troop of robots to turbocharge its manufacturing sector amid rising labor costs and an aging population.According to the CIE report, China is the world's largest industrial robot market, with an estimated value of $5.7 billion in 2019.Besides manufacturing, robots are being used in China in many more areas.A robot barista, developed by Chinese home appliance producer Gree Electric Appliances, has captivated many visitors at this year's WRC. The brightly-colored robotic arm can make and serve coffee, and can even create latte art.Also on display is Gree's famous robot band, comprising four robotic arms playing the piano, guitar, keyboard and drums. The band became an instant hit when it appeared on this year's China Central Television (CCTV) Spring Festival Gala, the most-watched annual television show on Chinese New Year's eve.Audiences at the WRC marveled at the band's performance as the four "musicians" moved their fingers swiftly and effortlessly on the instruments."It's magnificent. It's difficult enough to make one robot play the instrument according to the rhythm, let alone coordinating the performances of four robots," said Wu Hao, a Beijing resident who was experiencing the robot band for the first time. "I can see the great efforts the engineers have put into the robots."An Longxiang, a staff member with Gree's marketing department, said that the robot band is powered by advanced technologies such as flexible mechanical controls and precise algorithms, which have the potential to be used in medical care and other fields."The use of robots has expanded from the manufacturing sector to healthcare, service, consumption and other areas. These areas are the future of robots," said Qu Daokui, founder of major Chinese robot manufacturer Siasun Robot and Automation Co.

Nelson, chief technology officer of the project and professor at the Swiss university ETH Zurich."The robot will be clinically tested in China and Switzerland in February next year," said Liu Qian, president of Zhongrui Funing Robotics Co.Thus far, Liu's company has worked with robotics R&D institutions in countries including Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Japan, Germany and Italy, and has filed 52 patent applications, among which 23 were filed overseas.Many foreign robotics enterprises have invested and built factories or set up joint ventures in China, and Chinese companies are also looking for overseas partners and exploring the international market, said Xin Guobin, China's Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology, at a forum during the conference.In Beijing's Yizhuang economic development zone, where the WRC exhibition center is located, more than 180 robotics companies have set up operations, including strong foreign players such as Festo and the Yaskawa Electric Corporation. There were only 35 in 2016.Alois C. Knoll, a professor from the Technical University of Munich, said that he hoped to see more R&D collaboration between China and other countries, as well as further industrial cooperation between Chinese and foreign robotics companies."China will continue to make the WRC a bridge, take an active part and push forward cooperation in the robotics industry globally," Xin said. "We will encourage Chinese companies to work together with their foreign counterparts to put more research into application."Newspaper headline: Robots of the future
