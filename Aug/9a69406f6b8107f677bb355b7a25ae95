Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said that his company does not need to rely on US companies to roll out fifth generation (5G) wireless communication equipment.Ren made the remark during an interview with UK-based Sky News, and the content of the interview was published on the official Huawei website on August 15.Huawei, which was blacklisted by the US administration earlier this year, received a second 90-day reprieve earlier this week. That allowed the Chinese telecom giant to keep doing business with some US companies.Ren said that Washington's ban didn't have that much impact on his company, and the company has found substituted components that are actually preferable.Most of Huawei's more advanced equipment does not contain US components now, and these newfound alternatives even function 30 percent more efficiently, according to Ren.In August and September, Huawei will undergo a run-in period before it can mass produce new components itself, Ren noted.This means that Huawei can only produce around 5,000 base stations each month during that period, though it will be able to produce 600,000 5G base stations this year and up to 1.5 million next year, Ren said.Despite the ban, Ren said Huawei will continue to buy US-made components "in bulk" to the extent permitted by law, and said that trade globalization "benefits everyone."
