It is the first commercially operated nuclear power plant of its kind in the Chinese mainland, as well as the largest China-foreign joint venture project in the earlier stages of reform and opening-up, which began in 1978.In the past 25 years, the station has been running safely. As of Thursday, its Ling'ao 1 unit had safely operated for 4,823 days consistently, a world record.The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station "has earned a good reputation in the management, operation and safety in the World Association of Nuclear Operators, an organization of industry leaders," according to the website of CLP Power Hong Kong, the power station's partner in Hong Kong."Nuclear power is safe and stable. It essentially emits no residue or carbon emissions. We believe sustainable development of our nuclear projects will be one of our measures to ease global climate change," it said.Open to public"We always hold an open attitude toward the Hong Kong public," Yu Bo, section chief of public affairs branch at DNMC, told the Global Times on Thursday.In 2018, a total of 2,628 Hong Kong residents visited the power station, he said. Yu said that these visits are organized by CLP and can be booked online."At the beginning, the plant was visited mostly by nuclear power specialists and lawmakers, but now residents of all fields and ages come. Summer camps for Hong Kong students are also held here," he said.Yang Weizhi, director of brand and public opinion at DNMC, said that Hong Kong media organizations' concern toward the Daya Bay station has also changed. "At the very beginning, they discussed if the station was safe or not. But now they care more about our management and transparency."Zhao said that the Daya Bay station has insisted on openness to the public. It runs an open webpage showing information, statistics and conditions of the power station, which is a first in China.
