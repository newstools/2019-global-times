Russia on Thursday launched an unmanned rocket carrying a life-size humanoid robot that will spend 10 days learning to assist astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).Named Fedor, for Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research with identification number Skybot F850, the robot is the first ever sent up by Russia.Fedor blasted off in a Soyuz MS-14 spacecraft at 6:38 am Moscow time (03:38 GMT) from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Soyuz is set to dock with the space station on Saturday and stay till September 7.Soyuz ships are normally manned on such trips, but on Thursday no humans are traveling in order to test a new emergency rescue system. Instead of cosmonauts, Fedor was strapped into a specially adapted pilot's seat, with a small Russian flag in his hand. "Let's go. Let's go," the robot was heard as "saying" during launch, apparently repeating the famous phrase by the first man in space Yury Gagarin.The silvery anthropomorphic robot stands 1.8 meters tall and weighs 160 kilograms.Fedor has Instagram and Twitter accounts that describe it as learning new skills such as opening a bottle of water. In the station, it will trial those manual skills in very low gravity."That's connecting and disconnecting electric cables, using standard items from a screwdriver and a spanner to a fire extinguisher," the Russian space agency's director for prospective programs and science, Alexander Bloshenko, said in televised comments ahead of the launch.Fedor copies human movements, a key skill that allows it to remotely help astronauts or even people on Earth carry out tasks while they are strapped into an exoskeleton.Such robots will eventually carry out dangerous operations such as spacewalks, Bloshenko told RIA Novosti state news agency.On the website of one of the state backers of the project, the Foundation of Advanced Research Projects, Fedor is described as potentially useful on Earth for working in high ­radiation environments, de-mining and tricky rescue missions.Fedor is not the first robot to go into space.In 2011, NASA sent up ­Robonaut 2, a humanoid robot developed with General Motors and a similar aim of working in high-risk environments.It was flown back to Earth in 2018 after experiencing technical problems.In 2013, Japan sent up a small robot called Kirobo along with the ISS's first Japanese space commander. Developed with Toyota, it was able to hold conversations - albeit only in Japanese.
