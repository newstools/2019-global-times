US and Canadian fighter jets on Thursday intercepted Russian bombers off the coast of Alaska, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD tweeted that two US F-22 and two Canadian CF-18 fighter aircraft, supported by tanker planes and an early warning and control aircraft, "positively identified and intercepted two Tu-95 Bear bombers in the Alaskan and Canadian ADIZ (air defense identification zone) on Aug. 8th." "The Russian aircraft remained in international airspace in the Beaufort Sea and at no time did the aircraft enter United States or Canadian sovereign airspace," NORAD added. NORAD is a United States and Canada bi-national organization charged with the missions of aerospace warning, aerospace control and maritime warning for North America.
