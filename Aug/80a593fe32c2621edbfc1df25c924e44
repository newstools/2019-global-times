On July 11, the Egyptian parliament extended it for three months beginning July 25.That marked the ninth time the state of emergency has been extended since April 10, 2017, when President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi declared it for the first time following deadly bombings that targeted two churches in Alexandria and Tanta the day before, killing 44Â people.
