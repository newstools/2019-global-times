Potential decriminalization of drugs would have to be implemented with "responsibility" in order not to interfere with efforts to prevent drug abuse, especially among young people, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday. "We have to analyze it, we can't rule out anything that helps address this serious health issue, but we have to do it with responsibility," the president said during his daily press briefing, when asked if the government would consider decriminalizing drug use. Lopez Obrador said that his administration launched a campaign to "inform, guide and raise awareness among teenagers and young people" about the dangers of drug abuse, in order to reduce drug addiction. "Of course, that is not an isolated campaign, since it is part of our plan to address the root causes of drug abuse, insecurity and violence," he said. If the government does not act on this issue, "it is going to be very difficult, very complicated to secure public safety and peace," Lopez Obrador added. In 2018, Mexico recorded 35,964 homicides, with 29 criminal cases per 100,000 inhabitants, according to data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography.
