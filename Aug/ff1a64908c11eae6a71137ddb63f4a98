They'll have to deal with that themselves. They don't need advice."Trump's remarks represent a clear interference in Hong Kong affairs, and such interference was frequently seen with other issues, said Zhang Jiadong, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University.Geng said China hoped the US could "join hands" with China to implement the consensus reached between their leaders in Osaka and find a solution acceptable to both via dialogue and consultation based on mutual respect and equality.Trump's comments came as Hong Kong experienced its 11th consecutive weekend of protests. Hong Kong affairs are China's core interests which are more important than the trade war and if the US insists on linking Hong Kong with the trade war, there would be no room for further talks, Xue Li, director of the Department of International Strategy at the Institute of World Economics and Politics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.Xue noted that the central government is clear about the special nature of Hong Kong affairs and therefore will adopt an appropriate way that suits all sides."But the bottom line is Hong Kong belongs to China," Xue said.For more than two months, Hong Kong has been rocked by black-clad protesters who have kept escalating tensions and paralyzed the city's transportation and public order."The so-called democracy and freedom without rule of law and order will only lead to anarchism and social chaos, which will ultimately hurt the interests of the general public," Geng said. The most urgent and utmost task for Hong Kong now is to end violence and restore order, he said.The 11th round of China-US trade talks were held in Shanghai on July 30, which ended without agreement.
