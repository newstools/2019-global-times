Beef imports from Australia accounted for about 17 percent of China's total beef imports, which stood at 1.04 million tons last year.China's beef consumption this year is being partly driven by outbreaks of African swine fever. Also, China's beef consumption continues to grow as domestic consumption is upgraded, said Jiao Shanwei, a veteran analyst in the agricultural field.The quota on Australian imports, which was imposed to protect domestic producers, may be lifted as demand grows faster than production, Li said.The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) took effect on December 20, 2015. Imports from Australia have been substantially boosted by five rounds of tariff cuts thus far.Under ChAFTA, the tariff rate on beef from Australia was cut from 7-15 percent to 6-12 percent as of January 1, 2019, according to media reports.Under ChAFTA, China only imposes an import quota on a handful of goods such as beef to protect domestic producers.China and Australia have highly complementary trade structures. China has reiterated that it is willing to expand trade partnerships that respect free trade and multilateral trade rules, said Li.Free trade talks between China and Australia are expected to move ahead more quickly, and more imports from Australia are likely to enjoy lower tariffs soon, Li said.Newspaper headline: Australian beef imports grow rapidly
