Data from judicial, procuratorial, public security authorities and courts are all connected in the system. The AI-supported software was jointly developed by Shanghai's public security, procuratorial, and judicial authorities as well as domestic AI company iFLYTEK, thepaper.cn reported on Tuesday. In January 2019, the 206 System made its debut at a courtroom in the Shanghai No 2 Intermediate People's Court. Shanghai is building an AI pilot zone amid a worldwide AI race. It released a guideline in May to provide financial support to AI projects, including both basic theoretical research and related applications of AI core technology.
