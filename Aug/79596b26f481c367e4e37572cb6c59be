Chinese police have nabbed 29 suspected tomb raiders, and retrieved a passel of valuable cultural relics in east China's Anhui Province. Police in the city of Huainan discovered a clue in 2018, and later rounded up the tomb-robbing suspects that had ransacked an ancient grave dating back to the Warring States period (475 B.C.-221 B.C.) three times. Among the 75 retrieved artifacts, 26 were classified as national grade-one cultural relics, according to Li Anlin, deputy mayor of Huainan and head of the city's public security bureau. Around 40 kg of explosives, 15 detonators and some tomb-robbing tools were seized, according to Huang Shengzhong with the local public security bureau. Covering some 5,840 square meters, the graveyard is believed to belong to someone with the identity equivalent to a king of a state, and was labeled an important piece of the province's cultural relics in 1981. The local cultural relics protection bureau has intensified patrols and monitoring of the site.
