The National Meteorological Center issued a yellow alert Thursday morning as some parts of China are expected to see temperature above 35 degrees Celsius Thursday. The central and northern part of Jiangxi, northwestern Fujian, eastern Sichuan Basin, northern Guangdong, Hunan and Chongqing will see the temperature rise to 37 to 39 degrees Celsius, the alert said. Temperatures in some parts of Anhui, Chongqing, Guizhou, Guangxi and Guangdong are forecast to exceed 35 degrees Celsius. The center suggested people avoid outdoor activities in the afternoon while outdoor workers should take protective measures to prevent too much exposure to the sun. The safety of power equipment needs to be closely monitored as an electric overload might trigger fire-related disasters, it said. China has a four-tier color-coded weather warning system, with red representing the most severe, followed by orange, yellow and blue.
