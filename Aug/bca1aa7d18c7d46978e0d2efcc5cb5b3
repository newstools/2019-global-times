Patriotic Hong Kong residents pose for photos with the Chinese national flag at Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor on August 4. The banner reads "Opposing foreign forces' interference in Hong Kong affair! Traitors get out of China!"Photo: Chen Qingqing/GTThe US is openly playing Hong Kong as a card to exert strategic pressure on China amid the trade negotiations and escalating contention between the two countries, said Chinese experts, as senior US officials, institutions and foundations have increasingly lent support to prolonged riots in the special administrative region.US President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that "Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!"He (President Xi Jinping) is also a good man in a "tough business," he tweeted. "I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?"On June 10, the US State Department threatened to cancel Hong Kong's separate customs territory status in response to the Hong Kong government starting legislation of the extradition law.
