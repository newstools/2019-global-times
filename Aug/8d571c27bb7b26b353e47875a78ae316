The Research Vessel "Tan Kah Kee" of China's renowned Xiamen University opened to the Malaysian public over the weekend, providing a window for some 1,000 visitors on marine science. The opening days gave visitors an opportunity to learn knowledge of the ocean via advanced technologies with acoustic detection and deep-sea sampling equipment on board, with the assistance by volunteers of teachers and students from Xiamen University Malaysia (XMUM), said Wang Ruifang, president of XMUM. Wang said he was looking forward to more cooperation with Malaysian universities and research institutes. The research vessel Tan Kah Kee was named in memory of patriotic overseas Chinese businessman and philanthropist Tan Kah Kee, who established Xiamen University in 1921. The research vessel was formally incorporated into the State Oceanographic Research Fleet in 2017 and has conducted various scientific study trips since then. The vessel arrived in Malaysia after setting sail from Xiamen in July.
