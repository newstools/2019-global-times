Myanmar and Chinese authorities signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for a friendship forest project in Myanmar's capital Nay Pyi Taw on Thursday morning. Under the four-year project, a total of 3,353 saplings will be planted, covering the area of 7.53 hectares in Zabuthiri township. "We are pleased that residents and visitors in Nay Pyi Taw could enjoy a breath of fresh air produced by the forest when preparations to turn the city into a smart city are being carried out at the moment," said Nay Pyi Taw Council Chairman Myo Aung. The saplings include those of teak, gum-kino (Padauk), Mahogany wood, Thin Win (Burmese wood), gold mohur tree and Burmese star flower. Chinese Ambassador Chen Hai expressed his belief that Myanmar government's efforts on biodiversity preservation and environmental conservation could promote the socio-economic development of local people. He added that the joint-plantation of saplings symbolizes strengthening bilateral friendship between China and Myanmar. The first China-Myanmar friendship forest, covering the area of 40.5 hectares, was established in Magway region in 2017.
