Authorities with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have spotted signs of Bengal tigers in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region. Kunming Institute of Zoology under the CAS said Tuesday that the infrared cameras set up by its staff in Tibet's Metok County took Bengal tiger pictures for the first time there, indicating that the environment in the county is suitable for the survival of the big cats. Beginning in October 2018, the team led by Li Xueyou has set up 48 infrared cameras in the county, located deep in the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon. The county is the last one in China to get highways. In recent years, local villagers have reported seeing footprints of tigers. The pictures were taken in January. The cameras also caught footage of animals such as clouded leopards and golden cats.
