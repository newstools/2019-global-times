Two suspects were caught and over 22 kg of drugs were seized in southwest China's Yunnan Province, a major front in China's battle against drug crime. Police in the city of Baoshan received a tip-off regarding a cross-border drug trafficking case in early May. They soon conducted investigations and operations in the China-Myanmar border city of Lincang and arrested two suspects in Yongde County in mid-July. A total of 22.68 kg of heroin and a vehicle were also seized. The suspects, who are now under criminal detention, confessed that they planned to transport the drugs to Sichuan Province for sale. Further investigation is underway. Yunnan, which borders the Golden Triangle, is known for its rampant drug production and trafficking.
