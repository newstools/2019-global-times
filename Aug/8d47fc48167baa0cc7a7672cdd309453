Giant panda Hao Hao takes care of her new-born baby at Pairi Daiza zoo in Brugelette, western Belgium, on Aug. 8, 2019.(Pairi Daiza/Handout via Xinhua)Pairi Daiza, a zoo in Brugelette in west Belgium's Hainaut province, announced on Friday the birth of two panda cubs.The birth of one male cub, 160 grams, and one female cub, 150 grams, comes as no great surprise since mother Hao Hao had been successfully inseminated last April by male companion Xing Hui.However, reproduction cycle for female pandas is long and, often, highly unpredictable.This is the 2nd and 3rd birth of giant panda at Pairi Daiza after the birth of Tian Bao, a male, on June 2, 2016, a historic first for Belgium.It also presents new hope for the preservation of this species classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation Nature."The birth of the two giant pandas bears new fruit for Sino-Belgian friendship, which symbolizes that relation between our two countries continues to blossom. I am convinced that, thanks to the joint efforts of our two sides, the global partnership of Sino-Belgian friendship and cooperation will continue to deepen and widen, bringing more tangible benefits to the people of China and Belgium," said Cao Zhongming, Chinese ambassador to Belgium.For Eric Domb, president-founder of Pairi Daiza, the "double birth is wonderful news for this extraordinary species but today still threatened! We are proud, as a zoo, to collaborate in the rescue of the giant panda."
