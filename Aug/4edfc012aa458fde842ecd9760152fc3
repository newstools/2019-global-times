Mass production of an ultrathin rubidium clock, a high-temperature-resistant atomic clock that can be embedded in integrated circuits (IC), has been realized by a state-owned aerospace corporation recently, media reported. The clock is widely used in telecommunications, aerospace and other industries, including the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System.The "card rubidium clock" was developed by the 203rd Research Institute, known as Beijing Radio Measurement and Testing Institute, a subordinate institution of the Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp. It is reported that since the development of an initial product in 2018, the "card rubidium clock" has been widely praised for its high standard, reliability and small size. To date, the product has received orders from more than 10 companies, according to Science and Technology Daily.A rubidium clock is an atomic clock that measures atomic transition frequency using rubidium atoms and an optical pumping technique.Rubidium clocks are widely used in telecommunications, electric power, transportation, aviation, aerospace and other industries.The card rubidium clock is small enough to be directly embedded in the plug-in IC board, making it more convenient. The product adopts an anti-vibration design, which can ensure locking during transportation. The rubidium clock is resistant to temperatures as high as 70 C. In addition, the product offers a taming function, enabling it to be automatically recognized and tamed by the pulse per second (PPS) signal provided by users, improving the accuracy of local frequency with punctuality ability, media reported citing a person in charge. The 203 Institute is the only one in China capable of simultaneously developing rubidium clocks, cesium clocks and hydrogen clocks, and has provided a large number of high-performance satellite rubidium atomic clocks and hydrogen atom clocks for the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System.
