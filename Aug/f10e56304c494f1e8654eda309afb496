Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday pledged support to Kyrgyzstan and President Sooronbai Jeenbekov following a special forces operation to detain former president Almazbek Atambayev, the official Kabar news agency reported Wednesday. "We are indeed really trying to provide help and support to our friend and partner, the Kyrgyz Republic," Medvedev told Jeenbekov during a meeting held at the Kyrgyz resort of Cholpon-Ata. On the eve of the visit to Kyrgyzstan for a meeting of the heads of government of the Eurasian Economic Union, Medvedev told Russian media that Moscow is carefully monitoring the situation in the Central Asian country. He said he hopes the developments there won't lead to political and economic instability to affect the Kyrgyz people, and urged a strict observance of the law in seeking solutions. The special forces of Kyrgyzstan's State Committee for National Security carried out an operation leading to the detention of Atambayev on Thursday. A Bishkek court ruled earlier on Friday to put him into custody until Aug. 26, said Kabar reports. The Kyrgyz parliament voted on June 27 to strip Atambayev of immunity, after its special commission found that the ex-leader, 62, might be involved in six crimes, including corruption, during his presidency from December 2011 to November 2017. The Kabar reports on Wednesday said Kyrgyz special forces attempted several times to storm Atambayev's residence in the village of Koi-Tash near the capital of Bishkek, where supporters of the former president organized resistance.
