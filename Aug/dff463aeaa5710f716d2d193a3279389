Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted a press conference with the painting as a background on June 10.Blossom in Prosperity, featuring 218 blossomed peonies, was created by artists at the Juye Painting and Calligraphy Institute.The artists employed traditional fine brushwork skills, carefully outlining the peonies and painting them with splendid colors, bringing out the gorgeous and noble nature of this famous flower.The painting which is, 4.2 meters wide and 15.5 meters long, was created by 10 artists from the Juye institute in 77 days. The artists experienced major challenges during the creation process and revised the artwork nine times to meet the demands of the summit organizers.

We had to make compromise," he said.Hou Fuchang, another artist at the Juye institute, said people had doubts about their work during the preparation period for the events, but the Juye paintings finally stood out and became the only main background paintings for the events.Currently, artists from the institute are creating another giant peony painting for a key ASEAN event held in China later this year.Changing livesIn a large room of the Juye Painting and Calligraphy Institute, several painters were working in front of their huge desks.
