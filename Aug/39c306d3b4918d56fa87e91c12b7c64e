Sudan's opposition Freedom and Change Alliance and the Transitional Military Council (TMC) have reached a full agreement on a constitutional declaration, ushering in a new period for the transitional government, African Union (AU) Envoy to Sudan Mohamed Hacen Lebatt said on Saturday. "I'm very pleased to announce for the Sudanese, national, international and African public opinion that the two delegations have fully agreed on the constitutional document," Lebatt told a press conference in Khartoum. "The two sides will continue their technical meetings this evening to finalize the technical arrangements for the official signing ceremony before the Sudanese people," he added. The constitutional declaration stipulates the powers of the sovereignty council, the prime minister and the legislative council during the transitional period. It also addresses affiliation of the security and military bodies as well as the commissions of elections, border and peace. On July 17, the TMC and the opposition alliance signed a political declaration which determines the political structures of the transitional period. It stipulates the establishment of a joint sovereignty council of 11 members, including five civilians, five military representatives and one civilian to be selected through mutual consultation.
