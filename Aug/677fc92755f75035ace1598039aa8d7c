"As her family, we are so proud to establish 'Yingying's Fund' at the University of Illinois to remember her whole life," he said, adding that the sadness will be with the family forever, and hoped no family would suffer a similar tragedy, the report said. "Champaign is 7,000 miles away from our home; we didn't know who and where to ask for help," the father said, according to The Daily Illini. "When we arrived, there were so many people from the university and local community who helped us."Zhang Yingying's fiancé Hou Xiaolin released a statement in which he expressed hope that international students and their families would be able to receive the needed financial support when faced with emergencies in future, instead of feeling helpless as Yingying's family did when first arriving in the US, The Daily Illini said.The family made the decision to give an endowment of $30,000 to the fund, said the Associated Press. As of Tuesday, more than $58,000 has been raised by more than 494 people.According to the homepage of "Yingying's Fund," the fund may also be used to support family travel expenses of UIUC students in crisis, including airfare, lodging and meals, for the student's immediate family member(s) to support the student.Two years ago, Brendt Christensen murdered Zhang Yingying, dismembered her body and put the remains into three garbage bags. Christensen was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in July. Global Times
