The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Saturday fired two short-range projectiles off its east coast, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The projectiles, presumed to have been short-range ballistic missiles, were launched at 6:45 a.m. and 7:02 a.m. each local time from the DPRK's eastern town of Sondok in South Hamgyong province into the East Sea. They flew about 380 km at the highest altitude of some 97 km and a maximum speed of Mach 6.5 or higher. The JCS said in a statement that the DPRK projectiles were under the precision analysis by the intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States, noting that the South Korean military was closely monitoring relevant situation and maintaining a firm readiness posture. At the request of Japan, South Korea will share relevant intelligence on the DPRK projectiles with Japan because the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) remained effective, the JCS noted. South Korea decided Thursday to terminate the GSOMIA, which was signed in November 2016 with Japan to share military intelligence on the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs. The GSOMIA had been automatically renewed each year in August. As South Korea declined to renew it, the military intelligence-sharing pact will expire in November this year.
