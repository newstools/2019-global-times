The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Thursday condemned certain US politicians for colluding with the extremist and violent offenders in Hong Kong. In response to the latest false remarks by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others on the Hong Kong situation, the spokesperson of the commissioner's office said that these politicians have become almost hysterical in confounding right with wrong, applying bigoted double standards, and colluding with the extremist and violent offenders in a frantic attempt to destabilize Hong Kong and China as a whole. The spokesperson emphasized that the Chinese government and people are rock-firm in defending national sovereignty, security and development interests. Any plot or act to hold back China's development, damage Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and undermine "one country, two systems" will only be resolutely countered by all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Hong Kong, said the spokesperson.
