China urged the UK to stop its interference in China's internal affairs and stop making random and inflammatory accusations on Hong Kong, a spokesperson made the remarks on Saturday. "I'd like to point out that Hong Kong today is a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. Long gone are the days when it was under British colonial rule," Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said. Spokesperson of the British Foreign Office said that Foreign Secretary Raab had a phone call on Aug. 9 with Chief Executive Carrie Lam of the Hong Kong SAR on the situation in Hong Kong. Hua said the UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of supervision over Hong Kong when asked to comment on the call. Stressing that affairs of Hong Kong brook no foreign interference, Hua said the Central People's Government is responsible for the foreign affairs relating to the Hong Kong SAR in accordance with the Basic Law. "It is simply wrong for the British government to directly call Hong Kong's Chief Executive to exert pressure," she said, urging the UK to stop its interference in China's internal affairs and stop making random and inflammatory accusations on Hong Kong.
