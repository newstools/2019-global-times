(Xinhua/Francisco Canedo)Â Mexico expressed concern on Friday about the massive transfer of illegal arms from the United States during the Carribean nation's battle against drug trafficking. The United States identified Mexico as one of the 22 major drug transit and producing countries in a memorandum on Thursday, in which US President Donald Trump threatened to take action against the country "if it does not do more against drug trafficking". In response, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the memorandum does not have any legal effects on Mexico, and expressed its concern for what it described as a massive illegal arms transfer, which included high-powered weapons from the United States to Mexico. The statement also said that drug trafficking is a regional problem as it involves transnational criminal networks, and for that reason it needs all governments to collaborate. "Mexico is fighting the production and distribution of narcotics on its national territory, which many times comes at a high human and material price," the ministry said.
