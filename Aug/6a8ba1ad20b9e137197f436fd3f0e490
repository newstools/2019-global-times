At the seminar, the Uruguayan Minister of Industry, Energy and Mining of Uruguay Guillermo Moncecchi, Executive Director of Uruguay XXI Antonio Car√°mbula and the Uruguayan Ambassador to China Fernando Lugris gave an opening speech respectively. During the seminar, Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang also participated in the event and delivered remarks. In Moncecchi's speech, he noted why Uruguay, though a small country, can be a good partner with China. "Our two countries complement each other, we trust each other, and we have a lot to offer to each other," Moncecchi said. "Uruguay is a gateway to Mercosur [Southern Common Market - a South American trade bloc] and Latin America by being a regional business hub and its important role in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)." Zheng said in his speech that under the BRI framework, there will be plenty of opportunities for both sides to explore cooperation in the fields such as infrastructure, trade, scientific innovation and tourism. After the seminar, a ceremonial event was held during which Uruguayan cuisine, wine, dancing and music were presented.
