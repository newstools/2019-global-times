"Their actions show extreme defiance toward laws, and have severely damaged Hong Kong's international image and hurt the feelings of people from the Chinese mainland."  "We firmly support Hong Kong's police and judicial organs to carry out law enforcement, bring justice, and hold the criminals accountable," said Xu. Global Times
