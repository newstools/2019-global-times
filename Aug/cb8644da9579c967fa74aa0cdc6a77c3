Kim Jong Un, top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), watched the demonstration fire of new-type tactical guided missiles at daybreak Tuesday, sending an adequate warning to the US-South Korea joint military drill underway, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Wednesday. The report said two tactical guided missiles flied across the sky over the capital area and the central inland region of the country to precisely hit the targeted islet in the East Sea of Karea, which were launched at the operational airfield in the western area of the country. "The demonstration fire clearly verified the reliability, security and actual war capacity of the new-type tactical guided weapon system," said KCNA. Kim expressed high appreciation with the result of the demonstration fire, noting that "the said military action would be an occasion to send an adequate warning to the joint military drill now underway by the US and south Korean authorities." After watching the fire, Kim met the leading officials and scientists in the field of national defense science and workers in the field of munitions industry who successfully conducted the demonstration fire, KCNA reported.
