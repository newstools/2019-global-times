"It is as if a wonderful game of mirrors has eliminated the distance between the two ends of the Earth. That's the miracle of art."In the closing ceremony, the Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla's music was performed by Chinese musicians. Diplomats, media representatives and other guests were invited to give a tour at the exhibition after the ceremony.
