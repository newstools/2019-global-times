The chemical is used to clean and etch silicon wafers for semiconductors.South Korea's Samsung Electronics has also reportedly started to test Chinese-made substitutes for the chemical materials to avoid disruption to its chip production line."If the ban persists, this could be an opportunity for Chinese companies to step up and fill any void that may be open," Xiang Ligang, a Beijing-based industry analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Though the Japanese government showed signs of easing the tension by allowing exports of certain semiconductor manufacturing material to South Korea last week, the spat is far from being resolved as the divide between the two over deep-seated emotional and historical issues lingers.Xiang said that under a national drive to reduce reliance on foreign chips, Chinese companies at various stages of the supply chain have been scrambling to step up their research and development and production."I think they are ready to provide supplies if there is any market," he said.
