Violent radicals block a passage at Hong Kong International Airport in south China's Hong Kong, Aug. 13, 2019. Two months on, the escalating violence in Hong Kong has taken a heavy toll on the social order. Violent radicals committed acts of vandalism, blocked main traffic lanes, harassed urban commuters and set fires at will. Many have called for a brake to be put on the blatant violence and for order to be restored. (Xinhua) The law will lose its dignity when violations go unpunished and maintaining social order and stability in Hong Kong must rely on the rule of law, he noted.  Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs and Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability is the fundamental aspiration of all Chinese people, including the 7.5 million Hong Kong residents, and this will never be shaken by criminals, nor can it be changed by the interference of any external force, said the spokesperson.Global Times
