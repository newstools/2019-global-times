China on Friday donated 136 items of different agricultural equipment to Ethiopia, as part of China's efforts to support Ethiopia's largely agrarian economy. During the donation handover ceremony, Tan Jian, Chinese ambassador to Ethiopia, said the agricultural equipment donation to Ethiopia is part of China's drive to help Ethiopia modernize its agricultural sector. China's support to Ethiopia's agricultural modernization drive is part of a wider development cooperation between the two countries, Tan said. "Under the framework of South-South Cooperation, and driven by the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum of the China-Africa Cooperation, we will redouble our efforts to advancing our agricultural cooperation," said Tan. Ethiopia's Minister of Agriculture Oumer Hussien said that the latest agricultural equipment donation is part of wider efforts by China to support Ethiopia's economic development ambitions. "China's aid program to Ethiopia agriculture is significant in the areas of capacity building, technology and knowledge sharing," said Hussien. He added that China is serving as an inspiration for Ethiopia's poverty alleviation efforts, especially regarding China's remarkable agricultural revolution in the last four decades.
