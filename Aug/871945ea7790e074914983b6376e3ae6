Is that what some of these people want?"However, Wang also ensured that the central government will not leave Hong Kong behind because of the current situation. "We are confident about Hong Kong and sufficiently patient with Hong Kong's youth for their reckoning. But, for those who are behind the turmoil and who poisoned our youth, the country will not let them go easily. They will pay a heavy price," he said.
