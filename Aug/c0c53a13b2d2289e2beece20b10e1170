A Spanish woman has become the second foreigner in a week to be arrested at Kenya's international airport for wearing an ivory bangle, the wildlife service said Monday.Maria Pich-Aguilera, 50, was arrested on Sunday evening and pleaded guilty, paying a fine of 1 million shillings ($9,800) for illegal possession of ivory.The Kenya Wildlife Service said in a statement she was "arrested at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport with an ivory bangle," while traveling from Nairobi to Tanzania's financial capital Dar es Salaam. The woman was allowed to leave for Tanzania after paying her fine.Last week a Frenchwoman was arrested at the airport on her way from France to Mayotte for possession of an ivory bracelet. She pleaded guilty and also paid the 1 million shilling fine - the alternative is 12 months in prison."We noticed this new trend where ivory is smuggled through worked or processed bangles and we have increased surveillance," said an investigator speaking on condition of anonymity. Global trade in elephant ivory has largely been outlawed since 1989 after the animal's numbers plunged from millions in the mid-20th century.
