The third of a conceptual performance series named "2047 Apologue," directed by renowned film director Zhang Yimou, will be staged at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing from Sept. 13 to 15. The show will present the relationship between human beings and technology as well as the theme of environmental protection. Premiered in 2017, "2047 Apologue" was a concept theater show as it offers a blend of traditional Chinese arts and modern technology, which cannot be presented through common art forms such as operas and musicals, said Zhang. Chinese artists including several inheritors of intangible cultural heritage and a drone performance team from Switzerland will jointly perform in the new production.
