However, the personality rights bill in the draft civil code fails to draw a legal line for such matters, and the punishment mentioned in the bill was vague," said Zhou Youjun, a professor at the Law School of the Beihang University in Beijing.Zhou, who also heads the university's civil code research center, suggested a clear and total ban over human gene-editing practices. But Liu Changqiu, a health law expert and research fellow at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday that since human gene editing technology could be the future of medical practices for the sake of human health, a permanent ban might hinder relevant developments.However, Liu supports the legal regulations of human gene studies, noting that since the civil code addresses disputes, China should use more powerful criminal and administrative laws, instead of only relying on the civil code, to curb the practice.Gene-editing technologies should only be applied to human cells when the technology is mature enough and security is warranted. It is far from that, Liu said.
