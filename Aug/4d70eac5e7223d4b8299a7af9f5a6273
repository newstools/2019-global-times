Former deputy commissioner of the Hong Kong police Lau Yip-shing, who handled the Occupy Movement in 2014, returned to the police department on Friday, coming out of retirement to help deal with the ongoing unrest. Lau is likely to be the highest-ranking commander for the operation codenamed "Tiderider," initiated in mid-June to target protests and unrest triggered by the proposed extradition bill, Chan Cho-kwong, chairman of the Hong Kong Junior Police Officers Association, told the Global Times. According to the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Lau was appointed to the temporary post of Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Duty) on Friday. The main duties of this post are to assist the Commissioner of Police in handling large-scale, public order events and steering forthcoming major operations, including the celebratory activities surrounding the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China."Special Duty" refers to a designated position, which was previously below the rank of Chief Superintendent. The position at the Chief Superintendent level is unprecedented, Chan said.Lau joined the Hong Kong police force in 1984, and previously served at Hong Kong International Airport in its security service before becoming the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Operations) in 2016. According to Hong Kong media, Lau was also involved in dealing with the riots in Mong Kok during the 2014 Occupy Movement.
