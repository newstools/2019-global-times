The government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has approved from the Disaster Relief Fund a grant of about 3 million Hong Kong dollars (about 382,000 US dollars) for flood victims in Nepal. A spokesperson of the HKSAR government said the grant, via Amity Foundation in Hong Kong, would be used to provide food, tarpaulins, solar lights as well as hygiene items to the victims. The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee hoped the grant would facilitate the provision of timely relief to the victims and help them restore their normal living, the spokesperson said. "To ensure that the money is used for the designated purposes, Amity Foundation, Hong Kong will be asked to submit an evaluation report and an audited account on the use of the grant after the relief project has been completed," the spokesperson said.
