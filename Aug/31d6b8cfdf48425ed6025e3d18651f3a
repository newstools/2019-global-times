Chinese animated film "Ne Zha" continued to top the Chinese mainland box office on Tuesday, its twelfth day of screening, the China Movie Data Information Network said Wednesday. The domestic full-length animated feature raked in 151.61 million yuan (about 21.6 million US dollars) on Tuesday. Its total box office reached over 2.6 billion yuan, making it the highest-grossing domestic animated film. Telling the story of Nezha, a beloved Chinese mythical figure, the film features a daring overhaul of Nezha's appearance and depicts him more as a mischievous boy instead of the hero kid in previous cinematic works. "Ne Zha" was followed by a Chinese feature film putting spotlight on firefighters, "The Bravest," and domestic comedy "Coward Hero," which grossed 83.97 million yuan and 7.16 million yuan, respectively. "Ne Zha" took in over 59 percent of the daily total box office.
