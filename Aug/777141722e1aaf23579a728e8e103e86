That would be a disaster for Hong Kong and a complete and unbearable loss," Wang said. While the motherland has confidence and patience with the youth of Hong Kong, and is waiting for them to change their mind-set, if the street violence continues that "disaster" scenario is "completely predictable. Is that what some of these people want?" asked Wang. Newspaper headline: Nation will not spare ‘evil manipulators’
