Thirty-six percent of Americans approve of the job President Donald Trump is doing, while 62 percent said they disapprove, according to a new poll released Thursday. Nearly 8 in 10 Republicans approve of Trump's overall job performance, while 20 percent disapprove, according to the latest AP-NORC poll. In comparison, 94 percent of Democrats and about two-thirds of independents oppose Trump's leadership, the poll shows. The numbers are relatively consistent. Trump's approval rating has never dipped below 32 percent or risen above 42 percent in AP-NORC polls since he took office in January 2017, said the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Amid fears of a likely recession, 46 percent of Americans approve and 51 percent disapprove of Trump's handling of the economy, the poll shows. As for other issues, only 36 percent of Americans approve of Trump's foreign policy and gun policy, 37 percent approve of his health care policy and just 38 percent approve of his immigration policy. The poll surveyed 1,058 adults from Aug. 15 to 19 with a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points.
