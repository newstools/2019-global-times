The evaluation of the program conducted by the NSW education department in 2018 showed that the Chinese language program in 13 schools was satisfactory. The report by the NSW department said no evidence of "actual political influence" was found in the Confucius Institute.The report suggested the NSW education department renegotiate the cooperation agreement, and said that termination of the cooperation will reduce Chinese language and cultural activities that local students can participate in, and lose the opportunity for local schools to engage with native Chinese language teaching assistants. Global Times
