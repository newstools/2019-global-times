"This is one of those 'things that make you go hmmm'," Ma said.Officially, Flex has not made any statement that its decision was linked to the US trade ban on Huawei, although that's what Huawei claimed. Market observers said that Flex might have overreacted in that event.The Flex executive told Yicai that the company took one week to determine whether or not the materials were on the prohibition list of the US Department of Commerce.Flex is reportedly shedding some 10,000 jobs in China as two major factories in Changsha, Central China's Hunan Province and Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province had stopped work due to its row with Huawei.The anonymous executive said that the company's division for Huawei business may close.Newspaper headline: Huawei denies defaulting on funds to Flex
