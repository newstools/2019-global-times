China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday denied western media reports alleging that Huawei technicians have been helping governments in Uganda and Zambia spy on political opponents, which led to the opponents' arrests in both countries, saying it is "totally fake."Any attempts to smear China and deliberately harm China-Africa cooperation are set to be in vain, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang told a regular press conference on Tuesday.The remarks came after The Wall Street Journal reported on August 15 that Huawei has, in at least two cases, "personally helped African governments spy on their political opponents, including intercepting their encrypted communications and social media, and using cell data to track their whereabouts," citing senior security officials working directly with Huawei employees in these countries.Huawei sent a letter to The Wall Street Journal on Friday, denying the report, and said the article is "neither a fair nor a responsible representation of Huawei's legitimate business activities in these countries."The governments of Uganda and Zambia also denied the report.China has strengthened cooperation with African countries in sectors including police affairs and security, at the African countries' request, which has improved public security and social stability, business environment in Africa and was praised widely by local residents, Geng pointed out."To increase the social governance level by using modern technology products is an international practice. Why would the same quipment and technology used in other countries be described as spying on political opponents?" Geng asked.Â
