Venezuela's Foreign Affairs Minister Jorge Arreaza said Thursday that the resumption of the political dialogue with the opposition is possible through a "re-thought mechanism." "The mechanism that we had until a week ago resulted in a blockade, an attack, a continuation of conspiracy, and a coup attempt," Arreaza told reporters when attending an event gathering signatures against US economic sanctions. "A mechanism that guarantees peace, the coexistence and cohabitation of all the Venezuelan people" is necessary, he said. Arreaza said that although Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro decided not to attend the latest round of talks with the opposition, the government has not left the negotiating table facilitated by Norway, and surely "there will be contacts" in that regard. Regarding the collection of signatures against the US blockade, he said that the event was for the sake of national unity. "This is not an issue that concerns only President Maduro or the Bolivarian government, it is an issue of the Republic," he said. "These millions of signatures from Venezuela and the world go to the United Nations secretary-general in New York," Arreaza said.
