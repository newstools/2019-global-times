With the theme of "the economic and trade cooperation among Northeast Asian countries under Belt and Road framework," the forum attracted more than 200 guests from federations of industry and commerce and investment and trade organizations in China, Japan, Russia and other countries, who exchanged views on promoting the development of regional economic integration and other issues. A consensus was released at the forum that highlights the Belt and Road Initiative as a platform for inclusive development and providing new opportunities for countries worldwide. As a major event of the 12th China-Northeast Asia Expo, the forum aims to promote the development of economic cooperation among Northeast Asian countries and strengthen the cooperation of federations of industry and commerce in the participating countries and the rest of the world.
