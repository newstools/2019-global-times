China's Ministry of Commerce Thursday urged the United States to correct its faulty practices in anti-subsidy probes against Chinese products after the World Trade Organization (WTO) recently again ruled that US countervailing measures were inconsistent with WTO rules. On Aug. 15, the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO adopted the Appellate Body report and Panel report on China's complaints of US impositions of countervailing measures on certain Chinese products. The Appellate Body report, which was circulated on July 16 by the WTO, ruled that the United States acted inconsistently with provisions of the subsidies and countervailing measures agreement in 11 of its countervailing proceedings, said Gao Feng, a spokesperson with the ministry. Those reports in effect once again proved that the United States has abused trade remedy measures against WTO rules, which seriously damaged the fairness in international trade and the stability of multilateral trading system, said Gao. He called on the United States to stop looking for excuses and take immediate actions to correct its erroneous practices.
