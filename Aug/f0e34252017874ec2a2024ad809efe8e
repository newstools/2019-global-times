China has released a guideline to tackle difficulties in enforcing court orders, according to an office of law-based governance Thursday. The guideline calls for more transparency when enforcing judgments and harsher punishments for those acting against the enforcement. It demands a credit system that covers various aspects of social life including transactions, house property purchases, fees and tax payment and law violations. The market exit mechanism for businesses as well as systems of legal assistance, liability insurance and civil laws should all be improved, said the guideline. It also called for better coordination between different departments and efforts to improve judgment-enforcing personnel.
