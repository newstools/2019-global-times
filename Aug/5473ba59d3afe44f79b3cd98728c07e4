A delegation from Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan Province, submitted a bid for the 2023 Worldcon, one of the world's largest science fiction conventions, over the weekend.  The annual convention of the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) was first held in 1939. Every year, the location of future events are decided upon by members via a bidding and voting process. From Thursday to Monday, delegations from Chengdu, Nice in France and Memphis in the US submitted their bids, which will be voted upon next year at the 2021 Worldcon in Washington DC.  The Chengdu delegation presented the city's history, culture and its favorable tourism environment through salons, exhibitions, speeches and panel discussions. Experts from the China Association for Science and Technology, Sichuan Association for Science and Technology and the science fiction industry participated in these events as part of the delegation. It has long been a dream for many Chinese sci-fi fans to see China host a Worldcon event, said Jing Ge, vice chairman of the Sichuan Association for Science and Technology. Jing also extended an invitation to sci-fi fans around the world to attend the fifth China (Chengdu) International Science Fiction Convention which will be held from November 22 to 24.
