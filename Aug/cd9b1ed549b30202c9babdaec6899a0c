The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Thursday lodged stern representations with the US Consulate General in Hong Kong after an officer at the consulate general reportedly met with major "Hong Kong Independence" activists. In response, an official at the commissioner's office urgently summoned a senior official at the US consulate general to lodge stern representations, expressing strong disapproval and firm opposition, and requiring clarification. The official of the commissioner's office emphasized that China is rock-firm in upholding national sovereignty and security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and in opposing any interference in Hong Kong affairs by any country, organization or individual in whatever form. Members of the US Consulate General in Hong Kong were strongly urged to abide by international law and basic norms governing international relations, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and observe their obligations as consular personnel. They are also urged to "immediately make a clean break from anti-China forces who stir up trouble in Hong Kong, stop sending out wrong signals to violent offenders, refrain from meddling with Hong Kong affairs, and avoid going further down the wrong path," the official of the commissioner's office added.
