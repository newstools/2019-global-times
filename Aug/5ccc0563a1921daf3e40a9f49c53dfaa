"Without a doubt, it has more computing power than any other AI processor in the world."Industry analysts said that the chip series could be as competitive as major players such as products by Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia."As an industry giant that has so many business branches and lines, it's actually beat market expectations that Huawei could launch the chip in such a fast manner," Geng Bo, vice secretary-general of the China Solid State Lighting Alliance, a semiconductor industry association, told the Global Times on Friday.Huawei unveiled its Ascend chipset series in October 2018, which includes the Ascend 910 and the Ascend 310, with an extremely efficient system on a chip for low-power computing that can be used in smart devices.In 2017, it unveiled its first AI chip, the Kirin 970, and followed that up with the Kirin 980. The Kirin 990 is also on the way.From the Kirin series of smartphone chips and the Kunpeng series used in servers, to the Ascend series of chipsets for AI computing, the company is being "forced to do everything along the industry chain," in an effort to prevent a further block from the US, industry analysts said.The chips are only the beginning of Huawei's ambition to hold what it described as a full-stack, all-scenario AI portfolio. Huawei's AI portfolio includes its new Ascend series of AI chips - the world's first AI IP and chip series designed for a full range of scenarios, and it also includes new products and cloud services that are built on Ascend chip capabilities."We have been making steady progress since we announced our AI strategy in October last year," said Xu. "Everything is moving forward according to plan, from R&D to product launch. We promised a full-stack, all-scenario AI portfolio. And today we delivered, with the release of Ascend 910 and MindSpore. This also marks a new stage in Huawei's AI strategy."Huawei will debut more groundbreaking AI products, Xu said.
