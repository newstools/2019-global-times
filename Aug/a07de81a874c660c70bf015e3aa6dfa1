China Mobile Hong Kong (CMHK) introduced its first 5G experience store in Central of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) on Thursday. The two-storey flagship store, covering over 2,800 square feet, features a 270-degree panoramic ultra-wide screen that showcases the futuristic digital transformations brought by 5G. A wide spectrum of 5G capabilities are exhibited at the 5G Experience Zone, such as the remote claw robot arm and portable live broadcast backpack. Customers can also find the Smart Home Zone, where they can get their hands on all sorts of new digitalized products and discover how 5G make life easier at home. According to Joe Lian, the head of New Business Division of CMHK, 5G technology possesses advantages of low latency and high volume transmission over multiple simultaneous connections, and 5G is supposed to be 10 to 20 times faster than 4G. Hong Kong has already made preparations for the construction of 5G base stations, and will hopefully leap forward into the new era of commercial uses of 5G network around 2020, Lian said, adding that 5G will promote Hong Kong as a smart city, especially in the fields of intelligent drive, VR entertainment, education and telemedicine. Li Feng, the CMHK chairman, said that Hong Kong is well poised to reap the benefits of 5G technology. CMHK will actively participate in the SAR government's 5G bands auction starting in October this year. "We look forward to digitalizing the lifestyle of the public with our continuous effort in infrastructural development as well as a comprehensive network," Li added.
