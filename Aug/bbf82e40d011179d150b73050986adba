They can be exempted from fines if they meet the requirements.Jiangsu's action signals that daily activities can be included in the credit system in China, as the country is strengthening efforts to build a sound credit system, said Zhu.Several ministries and administrations have recently sought to promote credit construction in China, including the industries of transport and logistics, cyberspace and finance.
