Their extreme and radical actions that know no boundaries have jeopardized people' right to peaceful protests," Tse said, adding that the protesters are using potentially lethal weapons including bricks and Molotov cocktails."There are more and more innocent victims, including civilians, suffering at the hands of radical protesters," Tse noted, calling for the public not to rationalize or glorify violence.The police said they have received an application for a large-scale rally on Saturday, and they are assessing the risks involved. The police said they respect the public's right to express opinions in a peaceful way and refused to disclose possible deployment tactic in advance of the protest.
