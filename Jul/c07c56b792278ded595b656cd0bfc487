Only the United States, Russia and China have been on the moon, Reuters said.President of India Ram Nath Kovind was quoted in a report by the Indian news outlet The Hindu as saying that "Chandrayaan2 will be the first spacecraft to land close to the moon's south pole in some 50 days from now. The mission is expected to lead to new discoveries and enrich our knowledge systems."International efforts to explore the moon, including made by the Israel and India, as well as the US which is determined to send its astronauts back to the moon within five years, will be pressuring and motivating China's lunar probe missions to further develop, Wu noted."The international trend will not play a decisive role in China's planning on its lunar missions, and China is not going to compete with any one over the matter," Wu said. "China will pace itself against plans that have been already laid out in advance with each step surely achieving set goals."Wu also underscored that China's space projects have always been carried out in an independent and controllable fashion.Exactly a week ago, India announced a postponement of its second moon mission Chandrayaan-2 due to a technical snag in the launch vehicle system.
