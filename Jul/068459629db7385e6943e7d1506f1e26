Her 14-meter-long painting depicting the traditional Chinese Dragon Boat Festival will also be on display. Fu has been working to promote Chinese ink paintings worldwide even while creating Japanese festival-themed works. "The techniques of Chinese ink painting play a fundamental role in my paintings," the artist said. "To portray so many people at the festival, Chinese wisdom leads the whole process."
