Illustrations: Peter C. Espina/GTWith the approaching graduation season and summer holidays, the cosmetic surgery industry is ushering in peak time. New job seekers and students have become the main clients of medical cosmetology. In 2018, nearly 60 percent of those who went under the plastic surgeon's knife were less than 25 years old. A better appearance seems not only a need of the female, some men are also undergoing plastic surgery procedures. These youngsters believe a nose tweak or an eyelid correction can open doors to a better job and more friends. Though some jobs, such as flight attendants, prefer applicants with good looks, it is competence that matters for most employers. Rather than emptying their wallets and purses on a facelift or nip and tuck, youth should concentrate on honing professional skills. Time can tell on a beautiful face but not on competence.
