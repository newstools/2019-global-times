Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed to ease sanctions on North Korea at the right time to Donald Trump during the G20 summit in Osaka, Chinese Foreign Minister told the press on Tuesday. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said President Xi introduced China's position on the Peninsula issue during the G20, encouraging the US to act flexibly, including easing sanctions on North Korea at the right time and trying to solve concerns through dialogue.President Xi also had a number of exchanges with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and expressed support for the efforts that South Korea has made toward realizing this goal. Wang said, even though the world has entered the 21th century the Korea Peninsula still shows signs of the cold war. The fact that relevant parties harbor hostility and mistrust toward each other is restraining regional stability and the denuclearization of the peninsula, and this abnormal phenomenon should have ended long ago. "As a saying goes, 'nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it,'" Wang noted. Given this rare opportunity to embrace peace on the Korean Peninsula, China hopes the US and North Korea will turn the political willingness of the leaders of the two countries into dialogue as soon as possible in order to make tangible progress and continue efforts for the denuclearization and establishment of the peace regime on the peninsula, Wang said.The third meeting between Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took place on Sunday in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) of Panmunjom. The two exchanged unprecedented handshakes on the northern side of the demarcation line, making Trump the first sitting US President to enter North Korea. "This step is in response to the wishes of the people and in keeping with the trend of the era," Wang commented.This shows that the leaders of both countries are committed to solving problems through dialogue and negotiation, which is an important step in the right direction. China welcomes and supports this trajectory and hopes that the Korean Peninsula will be able to deliver more good news to the world in the future, Wang noted.
