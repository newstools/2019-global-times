Huawei launched a new cloud storage strategy called All-Flash on Tuesday, including its new generation speed cloud drive, which propels the speed of Huawei cloud storage solution hitting the microsecond level. The move will help expand the Chinese high-tech company's cloud storage portfolio for enterprises. Huawei's All-Flash storage plan aims to build an intelligent base for data, bringing cloud storage from the mechanical to the intelligent phase, and improving read-write speed of data from previous millisecond level to microsecond level. "The new intelligent data base will accelerate the development of innovative industries relying on cloud computing and meet the demand of various emerging applications for real-time data," said Zhang Yuxin, CTO of Huawei Cloud at a press conference in Chengdu, capital city of Southwest China's Sichuan Province on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Huawei Cloud obtained an information security service qualification issued by the China Information Technology Security Evaluation Center on Saturday, indicating that Huawei Cloud can provide high-quality and safe services for users.The global annual data increment will grow rapidly from 32.5 zettabytes (ZB) in 2018 to 180ZB in 2025. One ZB equals approximately 1-trillion gigabytes. The enterprise data utilization rate is only 10 percent, however, and the data value is not fully released, according to Huawei's report on Global Industry Vision.Huawei's new generation Input/Output (IO) cloud hard disk is the first product coming out of the strategic All-Flash plan, aiming to offer the maximum amount of low-cost storage while still keeping users' data safe.Huawei separated data IO and data control to reconstruct data reading and writing by chip. For example, some algorithms are offloaded onto chips that allow networks to write data directly to the cloud, saving about 60 percent of CPU overhead, thus overall energy consumption can be reduced by 30 percent.Cloud storage solution with elastic and unlimited expansion capacity is necessary for building an intelligent data base, to help resolve the explosive growth of data, experts say.
