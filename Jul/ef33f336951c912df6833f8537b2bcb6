(MENA via Xinhua)Â Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and King Abdullah II of Jordan highlighted on Monday the importance of resuming Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. Both leaders made the statements during their meeting in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, Egyptian Presidential Spokesman Bassam Radi said in a press release. King Abdullah arrived in Cairo earlier in the day on an official visit for talks with al-Sisi. During the meeting, they reaffirmed intensified efforts to restart the peace talks in line with the international resolutions and the Arab peace initiative and on the basis of the two-state solution, with the establishment of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. The last round of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis, brokered by the United States, lasted nine months and collapsed in April 2014, without achieving any significant breakthrough. A Saudi-led Arab peace initiative in 2002 urged Israel to fully withdraw from the Palestinian territories it has occupied since 1967 in return for normal relations with the Arab world, which was rejected by Israel.
