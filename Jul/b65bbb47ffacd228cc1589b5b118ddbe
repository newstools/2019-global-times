A private survey on Wednesday showed that growth in the country's services sector slowed to a 4-month low in June, due to the decreasing number of new export orders amid sluggish global trading conditions.The Caixin General Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a main gauge of activity at services companies, remained in the expansion territory though it slipped to 52 percent in June, 0.7 percentage points lower than the previous month, according to a statement from Caixin. New export orders for services fell for the first time in nine months, said Caixin, adding continuous weak external demand and rising tariffs are causing the decrease.Experts noted that the declined figure did reflect downward pressure on China's economy, both domestic and overseas, however it will likely rebound thanks to the easing of US-China trading tensions. "Since China and the US have reached a trade war truce, things are going to be different," Li Youhuan, a senior economist at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.China has resorted to multiple measures to boost its economy, including tax and fee reductions and business environment improvement. These measures have already stimulated the domestic market to some extent, though their impact has been offset by rising tariffs, Li noted."Now that external pressures have eased, plus existing positive internal policy incentives, economic data will soon recover," Li said.Top leaders from China and the US reached an agreement during the recently-concluded G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, to restart their trade consultations, and the US said it will not impose new tariffs on imports from China, Xinhua News Agency reported on Saturday.An earlier released Caixin Manufacturing PMI, which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises, stood at 49.4 in June and the same official PMI was released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday. A below-50 PMI suggests economic contraction, while an above-50 level points to economic expansion.
