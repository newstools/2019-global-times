US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently discussed Britain's future after Brexit over the phone, the White House said in a statement Monday. The two leaders "agreed to immediately deepen and expand the bilateral economic relationship upon the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union" in the call last Friday, the statement said. The statement said it was the first official communication between the two leaders after Johnson took office. Johnson succeeded Theresa May as Britain's prime minister on July 24 after an election by the country's ruling Conservative Party put him over his rival Jeremy Hunt. Trump congratulated Johnson on the victory in a tweet, saying "He will be great!" Trump, who was often at odds with May, is believed to be on friendlier terms with Johnson. Johnson is reportedly planning a trip to the United States before the Brexit deadline of Oct.31 to restore the bilateral relationship after leaked criticism made by Britain's former top diplomat in Washington triggered a backslash from Trump, and discuss possible trade deals.
