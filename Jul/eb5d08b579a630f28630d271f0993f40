The two new chips are an Op-amp chip and a Bluetooth SoC chip, read the statement."In terms of practical application, the chips could be used in industrial equipment inspection, human medical monitoring and others," Wang said.He said that the chips will have profound impact in fields such as AI and digital medical treatment, because thinner and softer electronic-sensing systems could be designed based on flexible-chip technology, which will be more sensitive to the environment and human body."The chips are just examples of our flexible technology, and we can apply the technology to a lot of other sectors," Wang said. "Flexible technology is the foundation of future electronic products manufacturing, but there are still many difficulties ahead of practical application," Wang said.Comprehensively promoting the application of the technology and cooperating with other industries is the next step, he said. "Flexible electronics is a frontier technology and it has promising market prospects," Geng Bo, vice secretary-general of the China Solid State Lighting Alliance, a semiconductor industry association, told the Global Times on Monday.Compared with conventional chips, flexible chips are thinner and lighter, with advanced ductility. They could be shaped for tailored scenarios, such as subskin implanted chips used for the measurement of blood glucose, Geng said.Technical problems including safety and stand-by times must be enhanced ahead of large-scale application, Geng noted.China has been stepping up efforts to rapidly develop its advanced technologies such as chips and foster its own industrial chains amid the trade war with the US.Newspaper headline: Ultra-thin chips mean transformation
