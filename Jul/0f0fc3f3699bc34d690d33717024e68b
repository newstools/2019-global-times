Airport customs in the city of Zhengzhou in central China's Henan Province said Thursday they had seized 78 kg of electronic waste smuggled through freight channels.The garbage was 2,695 integrated circuits, which are identified as waste sensing equipment banned from imports, according to the customs.Foreign electronic waste mainly includes discarded electric appliance and electronic equipment, some of which may be harmful to people's health and some may even be highly toxic.When such waste is incinerated, it will release harmful gases polluting the air, and when buried, heavy metals in the garbage may contaminate the soil and groundwater.China began importing solid waste as a source of raw materials in the 1980s and was the world's largest importer for years, despite its weak capacity in garbage disposal. Some companies have illegally brought foreign waste into the country for profit, posing a threat to the environment and public health.Given rising public awareness of environmental protection and China's green development drive, the country decided to phase out and halt such imports by the end of 2019, except for those containing resources that are not substitutable.
