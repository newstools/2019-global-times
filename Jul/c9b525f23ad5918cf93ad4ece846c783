China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the United States to correct faulty practices in anti-subsidy probes against Chinese products, after a World Trade Organization (WTO) report ruled that US countervailing measures were inconsistent with WTO rules. Upholding the findings of a WTO dispute panel announced in March 2018, the Appellate Body ruled Tuesday Geneva time that the United States acted inconsistently with provisions of the subsidies and countervailing measures agreement in 11 of its countervailing proceedings. The report once again proved that the United States has repeatedly abused trade remedy measures against WTO rules, which seriously damaged the fairness and equity of international trade environment, the ministry said in a statement on its website. "China has always respected multilateral trade rules and opposed the abuses of trade remedy measures," the statement said. Bringing the case to the WTO was aimed at protecting China's legitimate interests while maintaining the authority of the multilateral trade system and seriousness of rules, it added. In recent years, the US abuse of anti-subsidy measures has severely hampered normal exports of Chinese products, the ministry said, urging the United States to take actions to create a fair and stable trade environment for businesses in both countries.
