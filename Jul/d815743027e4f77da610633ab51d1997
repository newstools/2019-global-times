After a weekend of violent riots, Hong Kong anti-government protesters on Tuesday targeted the city's subway system during morning rush hour, causing the suspension of certain subway lines and forcing commuters to opt for other forms of transport.The latest move by protesters, who had been previously mainly targeting government buildings and the police, to cripple the city's public transport system further shows that they are willing to hold the city's livelihood hostage in pursuit of their ill-intentioned political goals.Heeding calls to stop subways in online group chats, several protesters gathered at the Tiu Keng Leng station around 7:40 am on Tuesday morning. Soon after, some apparently began to obstruct the automatic train doors from closing, thus delaying the trains from departing.There were only a few police officers on the scene who attempted to find the protesters, but due to the confusion caused by the large crowd of commuters, they could not find anyone. The protesters did not dress in uniform.After trains between Tiu Keng Leng and Kwun Tong were stopped for more than one hour, Hong Kong's metro authority suspended services, citing train door obstructions, passenger requests for assistance and someone having activated a safety device at the platform.These reasons cited by authorities were in direct contradiction to what protesters claimed was a strike by metro workers, in protest against the alleged wrongdoing of the metro system during a violent clash between protesters and unknown white-clad individuals in the Yuen Long district last week. It was not immediately clear whether any metro workers were involved in stopping the trains on Tuesday.At the Tiu Keng Leng station, some commuters could be seen shaking their head in seeming frustration, while a few complained only to be shouted at by protesters, who apparently told them to take the bus.

Asked to comment on the protesters, the commuter simply said, "What can I say?" and shrugged his shoulders before leaving the station for buses outside.Outside the train station, thousands were waiting in lines that stretched in several loops from the street to the back of the subway station. As rain began to fall shortly before 10:00 am, many opened their umbrellas while others ran for shelter inside the station.More police officers arrived at the scene, but thus far there have been no clashes and no arrests have been made.Tuesday's chaos at the train station followed a weekend of riots, after protesters illegally assembled on Saturday and Sunday night, when they constantly provoked police officers and committed arson in some cases. A total of 60 arrests were made over the weekend.
