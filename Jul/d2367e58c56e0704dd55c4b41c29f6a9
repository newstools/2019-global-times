The stubborn unwillingness of some countries to accept a multipolar world caused an increased level of global confrontation, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday."International law is scorned and strategic stability is undermined. All this hinders cooperation," Putin said in an address to the second international forum on the development of parliamentarism in Moscow.According to an official transcript, he said that the modern world faces big challenges and real threats that need to be recognized and dealt with by the entire international community.The discussion of an updated model of global development should restore such concepts as sovereignty and the right of countries to choose their own development path, Putin said.This will enable countries to reach agreements and adopt not just declarations but binding rules based on interests and responsibilities, he said.About 800 members of parliament and experts from 132 countries took part in the forum.
