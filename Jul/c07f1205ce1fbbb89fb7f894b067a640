Some Chinese enterprises have inquired with US exporters about the purchase of agricultural produce and applied for the lifting of tariffs on the products in accordance with the regulations of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, Chinese authorities said Sunday. The commission will organize experts to evaluate the applications. China and the United States are implementing the consensus reached by the two heads of state during the G20 Osaka summit. The United States recently announced a move to exempt 110 items of Chinese industrial imports from additional tariffs and expressed willingness to encourage US businesses to continue providing supplies for Chinese enterprises. In order to meet the needs of Chinese consumers, Chinese enterprises are willing to continue importing certain agricultural products from the United States that are marketable in China. Relevant Chinese authorities have expressed hope that the United States will meet halfway with China and earnestly implement its commitments.
