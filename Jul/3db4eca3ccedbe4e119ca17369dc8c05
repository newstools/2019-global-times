Turkish Presidential Spokesman Ibrahim Kalin held a conversation with US National Security Adviser John Bolton by phone on Thursday, discussing Turkey's exclusion from the F-35 fighter jet program. During the call with Bolton, Kalin expressed Turkey's unease over Washington's decision, said a statement by Turkey's presidential office. On Wednesday, the White House announced that it was removing Turkey out of the F-35 fighter jet program over Ankara's purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense systems. Kalin said that "unilateral impositions" would prevent the progress of Turkish-US ties. Despite the recent disputes, the two senior officials also discussed a possible date for US President Donald Trump to visit Turkey, the statement added. Early on Thursday, Turkish Foreign Ministry said that the US move is "against the spirit of alliance," and "might bring irreparable damage to bilateral relations." Last week, Turkey began taking the delivery of Russian S-400 missile components, which are set to continue through April 2020. Turkey planned buying more than 100 F-35 fighter jets and its defense companies were also involved in producing the modern jets.
