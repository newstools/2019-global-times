In the minister's speech, he expressed his gratitude for the unique privilege and honor to visit China and praised China's role as a global leader and a contributor to regional and world peace and development. "In a matter of a few decades, China has become a global leader and trendsetter in so many different areas, ranging from poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, social progress and economic growth to advanced technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence and cloud computing. These monumental achievements have transformed not only Chinese society, but also created opportunities for other countries, especially for neighboring countries like Nepal," Gyawali said. "We greatly value our relations with China and appreciate its continued support to the people of Nepal irrespective of major political changes in Nepal and changes in the outside world. We are firm on the one-China principle and on not allowing Nepal's territory to be used against China's interests," he said. The Nepalese Ambassador to China Leela Mani Paudyal hosted the event.
