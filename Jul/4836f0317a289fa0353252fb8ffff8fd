"The compiler means the apps can be ready for HongMeng without having to be developed from scratch. And as more apps operate in the system, more developers will have the incentive to engage with it."HongMeng also has a broader application range than most OS. According to the report, the HongMeng OS will be installed not only in smartphones but also in applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial automation, with less than five milliseconds of processing delay, Ren was quoted as saying.   "Given its focus on processing delay, the HongMeng OS is still largely a system for industrial automation rather than smartphones," said Fu Liang, a Beijing-based independent industry analyst.It is still an emergency backup plan prepared for the worst case scenario. To take over the current dominant OS would be costly and require a new set of negotiations and verification with network providers, Fu said.Currently, the HongMeng OS is being tested at a relatively small scale, but around 1 million devices equipped with HongMeng OS will be shipped before the end of the year, the report said.  "A very likely strategy for Huawei is to select a specific type of phone to have the OS installed to test the waters," Xiang said. "And by trial and error and collating the market response, Huawei will have a better idea how to update the system."
