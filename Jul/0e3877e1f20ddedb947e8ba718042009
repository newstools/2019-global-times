Local workers are not as dedicated as the Chinese," said Wu.The major reason for the leave-then-return trend was fast rising labor costs and policy uncertainty, said a well-informed shoe manufacturing business owner surnamed Wang in Gaobu township, Dongguan. Gaobu used to have a cluster of factories that produce shoes for international brands like Nike and Adidas. "Some have retreated from Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam. Every company has different problems in funds, partnership or operations. But the major common reason is that local labor requirements for welfare are rising so fast that it is beyond their expectations," said Wang. "Newly emerged policies on areas such as environmental protection and foreign investment management are adding restrictions to Chinese companies."Another key reason was that companies cannot leave China without compromising the quality standards of their products, said Wang. "The quality Dongguan accumulated in 30 years cannot be matched by new overseas venues which just have a few years of development."Made in USASince Trump became as president, one of his key agendas has been pushing American firms to return to the US and build manufacturing facilities.To this end, the Trump administration designated July 15 as Made in America Day and this week Made in America Week. However, media reports have shown that bringing factories back to the US is no easy job and the US is feeling daunting challenges when it comes to supply chain relocation.In 2018, US-based motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc, which showcased their products at the White House at the invitation of Trump, it would move some production capacity out of the US to Europe to avoid the impact of Trump's tariff war. In June Harley-Davidson even inked a deal with China's Qianjiang Motorcycle Company to tap the Chinese market.Electric car maker Tesla also set up its first overseas gigafactory in Shanghai in 2019, and the plant construction moved at an exceedingly fast pace with reported trial production set for September.Trump's tariffs slapped on Chinese imports haven't sparked the widespread return of manufacturers to the US he envisioned, USA Today reported on Friday.Citing a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, fewer than 6 percent of American companies are considering moving their factories from China to the US because of the trade war, the report said.
