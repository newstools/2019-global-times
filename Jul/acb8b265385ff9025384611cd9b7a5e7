For example, an activity named "where the garbage goes" would organize primary and middle school students to visit local demonstration residential areas, garbage transfer stations, refuse landfills and incinerators where the waste disposal work runs. Apart from public activities, the institute is also committed to research on urban waste disposal and waste resource utilization.Through the trial operation which lasted half a year, the institute researched on biotechnology disposal of kitchen waste and applications of mud solidification technology for recycling construction waste. The institute also drafted the industry standards in the city to ensure the industry's sustainable development.China will invest 21.3 billion yuan ($3.09 billion) in trash sorting in 2019, and 46 cities will be integrated into the sorting network by the end of 2020.
