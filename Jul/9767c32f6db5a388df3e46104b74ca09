India on Monday successfully launched its Moon Mission-2, or Chandrayaan-2, which was aborted on July 15 due to a technical snag. The rocket GSLV-Mk-III carrying the Orbiter, Lander Vikram and Rover Pragyaan took off at 14:43 (Indian Standard Time) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, off the Bay of Bengal coast located in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The Lander and the Rover are expected to touch down near the Lunar South Pole in early September, becoming the first ever spacecraft to land in that region. If successfully carried out, India would become the fourth country, following the US, Russia and China, to achieve this feat. Earlier on Monday, scientists of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) offered prayers at temples near the base and said there would be no repeat of last week's problem.
