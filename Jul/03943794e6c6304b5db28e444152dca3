The orchestra's lasting ties with China mark a significant chapter in its century-old history.In 1973, at the invitation of then US president Richard Nixon, it became the first US orchestra to visit the People's Republic of China - a trip considered a key part of Washington's rapprochement with Beijing in the 1970s.The Philadelphia Orchestra's relationship with China predated the official ties between the two countries, said the senior executive, adding that his orchestra's bond with China has withstood the ups and downs in bilateral ties at the national level."The constant is that we're still making music and connecting with people," said Fleur, who has been to China 13 times in the last seven years in an effort to strengthen the orchestra's partnership with the Asian country."We're thrilled to be the vehicle to try to bring the world a little closer," he said.Fleur said he believes in the power of music, noting that the beauty of melodies "transcends language, culture and boundaries," which is an important instrument for facilitating China-US cultural exchanges and improving mutual understanding.Through musical and cultural exchanges, "we could find a lot in common," and that kind of people-to-people connection "is particularly important when we are from two great countries that represent such a large part of the world," said Fleur, who is also an experienced pianist.The Philadelphia Orchestra's interaction with its Chinese counterparts has been flourishing since its first historic visit to China about 46 years ago.The orchestra enjoys a long-standing partnership with the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing and the Shanghai Oriental Art Center. In addition, it has worked with the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra since 2016 in advancing cultural exchanges between the US and China.This May, it wrapped up its 12th tour to China, which was also aimed at marking the four-decade milestone in China-US diplomatic relations.The famed US orchestra has held concerts in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, along with coaching sessions in colleges."We try to connect every year...The full orchestra would go back every year. And in between, we've developed many strategic partnerships in Beijing, Shanghai and throughout China with orchestras, performing art groups and media companies, to be able to use music to reach large numbers of people and to further relationships," Fleur said.
