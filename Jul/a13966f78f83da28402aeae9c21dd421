Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Tuesday that the Summer Davos Forum is a platform for all market players, giants and growth firms alike, to seek fair competition and common development. Li made the remarks when addressing the opening ceremony of the Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2019, also known as the Summer Davos Forum, in the city of Dalian. The Summer Davos Forum has been held in China for 13 years. Economic growth relies on the power of market players. Big firms are expected to keep seeking excellence, while growth enterprises are expected to forge ahead, Li said, adding that only in this way can they adjust to the rapid market and industrial changes. Hence "New Champions" has been the theme of the event since the very beginning, and is still very relevant today, according to Li.
