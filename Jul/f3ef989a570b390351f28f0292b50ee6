They cannot claim to be fighting to bring good governance to the country," he said in a statement issued in Mogadishu.Ten foreigners including two Americans, one British, three Tanzanians, three Kenyans and one Canadian are among those killed in the attack that also left two Chinese among those injured.Al-Qaida allied group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying four of its fighters entered the building with a car laden with explosives and carried out the attack.Madeira said AMISOM forces will continue to support the Somalia security forces as they continue to liberate areas that remain under the control of violent extremists.
