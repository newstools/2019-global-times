Police in Poulsbo city in the US western state of Washington shot dead a man during a fireworks show on the eve of US Independence Day on July 4, a Washington online newspaper reported Thursday. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer quoted the Poulsbo Police Department as saying that police officers received reports of a man threatening people as a large crowd were converging at Waterfront Park of Poulsbo city to watch the fireworks show on the eve of the US celebration of "Fourth of July" Independence Day. Several police officers responded to the call and found the man, but a struggle occurred shortly between the man and the police, said the newspaper. One of the officers shot at the man with his handgun and struck him, who later died from gunshot wounds. Police did not disclose the victim's identity nor other details including his age and residence. Police said the incident caused chaos on the scene of the fireworks performance, and sent families and young children fleeing in panic.
