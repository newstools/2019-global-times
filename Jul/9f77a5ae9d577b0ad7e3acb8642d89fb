But in those cases, it was the media that reported the drills first, before the Defense Ministry confirmed them.The Sunday statement by the Defense Ministry did not specify which branches could be involved in the drills, only saying that it was the PLA, so all five military branches - the Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, Rocket Force and Strategic Support Force - could be participants in this possibly high-level, large-scale joint exercise.Another military insider, who also asked not to be named, told the Global Times that the wording of the statement suggest the exercise was not led by a single military branch, and it might be organized by a joint command center of the Theater Command or even of the Central Military Committee.Foreign media and media on the island of Taiwan suggested the PLA exercise might be connected to the recent approval by the US of a possible arms sale to the island, and Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's transit through the US.The military insider said the timing could be coincidental, because the PLA conducts all kinds of military exercises in the vicinity every year.But the statement of the Defense Ministry does not include phrases like "The drills are not aimed at any specific target," or "There is no need for over-interpretation," which are common in other exercise announcements, the anonymous expert pointed out, noting that this could be an indication that the exercise this time indeed has a specific target in mind.The exercise can better test the PLA's ability to thwart any secessionist activities and maintain the  national sovereignty and territorial integrity,  the insider said. The more Taiwan secessionists stir up trouble and the more foreign support Taiwan secessionists receive, the sooner the day arrives when China becomes reunified, the insider added.
