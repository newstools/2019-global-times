What makes the burger really "Chongqing style" is a specially made sauce that tastes very much like hot pot. Hot pot lovers became jealous of Chongqing people after the shop went viral on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo. "OK, it's time to book a ticket to Chongqing and try all the foods," one Net user posted on Weibo.  Chongqing is famous for its hot pot and spicy cuisines. Some shops even sell ice cream and yogurt with hot pot sauce replacing the fruit jelly or chocolate toppings. Pear Video
