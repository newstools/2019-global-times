More than half are looking to invest in emerging markets, while the proportion of China CEOs that plan to invest in developed markets also increased compared with last year's results.Over 60 percent of China CEOs and a similar proportion of global CEOs said they are prioritizing Belt and Road countries and regions when expanding to emerging markets, the report showed.
