It is necessary for the two to strengthen their strategic cooperation to safeguard regional and global stability and peace, Wu said.However, unlike the US, which poses threats to regional stability, "the cooperation between the two countries always sticks to 'partnership over alliance, dialogue over confrontation," Yang noted.He added that the two are always determined to safeguard regional and international peace and stability.China and Russia conducted their first joint strategic reconnaissance flights in Northeast Asia on Tuesday and did not enter a third country's airspace, said Chinese Ministry of National Defense spokesperson Wu Qian on Wednesday.The joint flights were aimed at deepening and developing a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Russia in the new era, and further enhancing the joint operational capabilities of the Chinese and Russian militaries, Wu said. The operation is aimed at jointly safeguarding global strategic stability.
