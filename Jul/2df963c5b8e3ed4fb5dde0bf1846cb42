China will award professional titles for those graduating in specialized intellectual property (IP) majors, a move an analyst said was intended to advance the proficiency and team building of IP professionals, amid pressure from the US over allegations that Chinese companies have stolen IP from American companies. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MHRSS) has released guidelines to advance reform of the title system for professionals working in fields related to economics. It will establish majors specializing in IP and grant professional titles that will be named after the majors, online news site people.com.cn reported Friday.Professional titles of the IP majors will include Assistant IP Specialist, IP Professional and Senior IP Professional, according to the guidelines.Compared with other majors, an IP major needs to focus on multiple subjects, as it not only involves economic principles and basic knowledge and assessment of policies and regulations, but also demands engineering and legal knowledge, according to an official from the MHRSS."The addition of professional titles in the IP sector will greatly improve the evaluation system for industry professionals," an industry analyst surnamed He told the Global Times.He said that China has made great efforts to advance its IP industry and such efforts cannot be ignored by other countries like the US, which continues to discriminate China.In the first half of this year, China completed 3.515 million trademark registrations, an increase of 67.8 percent year-on-year, news site thepaper.cn reported on Sunday.The number of IP professionals in China has expanded quickly in recent years as the country has attached great importance to IP protection, He said, noting that as a result, there will also be more people specializing in IP management in the future. According to the plan, the number of China's IP professionals will reach more than 500,000 by 2020 and the number of employees working in the IP industry will exceed 1 million.
