Spokesman of Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abbas Mousavi said on Monday that if Europe doesn’t take a practical action to remedy its renegade on commitments to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran will implement the third phase of reducing commitments decisively.Mousavi made the remarks in his weekly briefing to the press.Asked about the outcome of the JCPOA arbitral commission held in Vienna on July 28,  Mousavi said that the commission convened at the requests of both Iran and Europe. Europeans were unhappy with Iran's reducing commitments to the JCPOA; and Iran criticized them for their inaction, as well as following the US lead like arrest of some Iranian citizens and extraditing them to the US at the behest of Washington.Mousavi said that these people were arrested due to US unilateral and oppressive sanctions, which even did not exist when they were arrested.He added that diplomatic encounters are underway in the form of bilateral meetings and the joint commission to keep the JCPOA alive.
