Ireland will step up its preparations for a disorderly Brexit this week given the chances of Britain leaving the EU without a deal have never been higher, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Monday.With close trade links and a shared land border, Ireland is considered the most vulnerable among remaining EU members to Brexit and lawmakers passed one of the largest-ever pieces of legislation in March to prepare as best it could for a no deal.Coveney said the updated contingency plan will refine and improve on the actions already in place for March 29 and April 12, the original Brexit deadlines before Britain was given an extension until the end of October."One of the biggest dangers Ireland faces in the weeks ahead is the 'boy who cried wolf' effect, whereby people and business assume that because a disorderly Brexit was averted in March and April the same will happen in October. To assume this would be a serious error," Coveney wrote in the Irish Times."The chances of a disorderly Brexit have never been higher and the Government now considers the risk of this outcome on October 31st as 'significant.'"How to manage the land border between EU-member Ireland and British-run Northern Ireland remains the most contentious element of the divorce deal that the contenders to become the next British prime minister want renegotiated.
