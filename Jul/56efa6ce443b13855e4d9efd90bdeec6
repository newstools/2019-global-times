Chinese arms industry giant China North Industries Group Corp (NORINCO) on Saturday said it has reached a cooperation consensus with domestic technology giant Alibaba Group for the application of its proprietary BeiDou Satellite Navigation System (BDS), by giving full play to NORINCO's traditional technological advantages and Alibaba's ability of innovation.The cooperation will greatly accelerate the application of China's BDS to further promote military technology and civilian economic development, experts said.Jiao Kaihe, head of NORINCO, met with Jack Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba and Zhang Yong, CEO of the group with topics focusing on mutual cooperation in the application of BDS, according to a statement posted on NORINCO's WeChat account on Saturday."As important strategic partners, there is great potential for NORINCO and Alibaba to further complement each other's advantages and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes," said the statement, citing Jiao.Leaders from NORINCO and Alibaba mentioned their intention to support the development of Qianxun Spatial Intelligence Inc, a high-precision positioning services provider jointly founded by NORINCO and Alibaba in 2015."Precise time-space service is of great significance to promote economic and social development," said the statement, citing Zhang.To realize the civilian application of such a mega military project, advanced technology must be embedded in civilian service systems, such as bike-sharing platforms, Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Sunday."Alibaba has the advantage of software, such as big data and cloud computing, while NORINCO's BDS possesses advanced terminal hardware systems," Li said.To comprehensively combine the advantages of both sides, military technology could generate great momentum to drive civilian economic development as well, such as applications involving navigators and locators, Li said.According to BDS, China has realized the independent development of basic satellite navigation products, and has gradually applied the technology to various fields of national economic and social development, including transportation, agriculture, electricity and public security.
