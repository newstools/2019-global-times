Gou probably will stand up for Han as his next step," Yang said.Gou announced April 17 that he would run in the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election. Enthusiasm for Gou was interpreted by Chinese mainland analysts as evidence that the people in the island want a respite from the worsening cross-Straits situation caused by the pro-secession DPP which currently governs the island.
