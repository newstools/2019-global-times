A supersonic aircraft can fly more than twice as fast, which would solve the problem of long travel times, the CCTV report said.    "Green supersonic civil aircraft is currently a hot research topic internationally, as well as the direction of future aerospace development," Xu Yue, a senior engineer at the Chinese Aeronautical Establishment under the state-owned Aviation Industry of China, told CCTV.Other countries including the US, Japan and some European countries have also announced their concepts for supersonic civil planes, CCTV said.China has already made breakthroughs in some of the key technologies like reducing air resistance and sonic boom, the report said."We hope that, through our own technological development and continued scientific investment, we can launch our own supersonic civil aircraft prototype in around 2035," Xu said.Global Times
