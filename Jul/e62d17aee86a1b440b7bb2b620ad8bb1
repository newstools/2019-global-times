CSIC was designated the "northern ship" and CSSC became the "southern ship" due to their geographical locations. The two companies also witnessed the rapid development of China's civil shipbuilding industry, and the struggles after the industry was affected by the 2008 global financial crisis.The merger, coming 20 years later, is in accordance with China's policy guideline of building stronger enterprises to improve market competiveness, according to analysts.Feng Liguo, a research fellow at China Minsheng Bank's research center, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the planned merger is further implementation of China's mixed-ownership enterprise reform to build larger and stronger enterprises."Only through internal reform aimed at improving the vitality of enterprises can the competitiveness of companies be strengthened," Feng said.This merger, if it goes ahead, would not be the first combination of resources among state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In December 2014, the two largest state-owned train manufacturers in China - CSR Corp and China CNR Corp - also announced their merger.The shipbuilders' merger will not simply mean operating as one company. It will require internal integration and cooperation to achieve optimal governance, Zhou Liwei, a veteran analyst in the shipbuilding industry, told the Global Times on Tuesday.SOE mergers in other industries have been proved effective, Zhou added.Newspaper headline: Long-awaited merger set for state shipbuilders
