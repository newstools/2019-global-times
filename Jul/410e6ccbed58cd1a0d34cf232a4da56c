Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime Ortega died on Friday at the age of 82 after a long battle against cancer.
His tireless pastoral work and his love for Cuba led him to strengthen relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the Cuban state, the Cuban government said in a statement.
The obituary indicates that Cardinal Jaime had passed away and despite his physical absence, they relived, with grateful affection, the memories of his personal quality and tireless pastoral zeal, Prensa Latina reported.
It is not possible to include in this obituary the fruitful work of his priestly years in the Diocese of Matanzas and as bishop in the Diocese of Pinar del Rio and in the Archdiocese of Havana, Monsignor Juan de la Caridad Garcia Rodriguez, Archbishop of Havana, said in the report.
Ortega became Archbishop of Havana in 1981, building a working relationship with the Cuban government.
In talks between Cuba and the US that led to detente in December 2014, it was Ortega who relayed messages between Pope Francis, Cuban leader Raul Castro and then-US President Barack Obama.
Floral offerings by Army General Raúl Castro Ruz, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, and Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, president of the Councils of State and Ministers, accompanied the funeral honors for Cardinal Ortega.
