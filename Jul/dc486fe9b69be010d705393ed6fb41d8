And it's still right here on this platform and it's not going to go away," he said.The trailer revealed the surprise return of other popular characters including Data (Brent Spiner) and Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) who then joined the cast and producers on stage.It showed an age-worn, soul-searching Picard living back on Earth on his vineyard, and struggling to reassimilate. A mysterious young woman comes to him for help, before a few brief clips showing him seemingly back aboard a spaceship. Jonathan del Arco and Jonathan Frakes will also return, it was announced.Star Trek, a multi-billion dollar cultural phenomenon beloved by fans worldwide, turned 50 in 2016.The Next Generation ran from 1987 to 1994 with 178 episodes, and spawned several films, the last in 2002.The new show is not a direct sequel, and will be more character-driven, said executive producer Akiva Goldsman.Stewart recalled how his children explained to him what Star Trek was when he was first approached as a stage actor in the 1980s."I'm deliriously happy that now I have four grandchildren who have the same attitude to what we're doing," he said, describing how his grandson Mason had begged to be allowed to see the trailer first. "That gave me great satisfaction."Addressing his decision to return after years of dismissing the possibility out of hand, the X-Men star said: "I knew that something very unusual was going to happen. I wanted to be a part of it.""To imagine that something like this might go ahead and I wouldn't be there, would have been just too defeatist."Picard will be released in 2020.
