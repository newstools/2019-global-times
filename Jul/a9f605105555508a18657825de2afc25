An Indonesian customs officer inspects containers filled with trash originating from Australia at a port in Surabaya on Tuesday. Photo: AFPIndonesia said Tuesday it would send more than 210 tons of garbage back to Australia, as Southeast Asian nations push back against serving as dumping grounds for foreign trash.The eight containers seized in Surabaya city should have contained only waste paper, but authorities also found hazardous material and household trash including plastic bottles and packaging, used diapers, electronic waste and cans, a spokesman for the East Java customs agency told AFP.Following the inspection, the ­Indonesian environment ministry recommended "the items be re-exported," the agency said in a separate statement on Monday. "This is done to protect the public and Indonesian environment, especially in East Java, from B3 waste," it added, referring to hazardous and toxic materials.Australian company Oceanic Multitrading sent the waste to Indonesia with help from Indonesian firm PT. MDI, authorities said.Western countries were hit heavily at the start of 2018 when China banned the import of 24 types of solid waste. They had long relied on exporting plastic recycling to China and have been lax about recycling domestic waste.Huge quantities of rubbish have since been redirected to Southeast Asia, but opposition to handling exported trash is growing in the region.Indonesia announced last week it was sending back 49 containers full of waste to France and other developed ­nations.In May, neighboring Malaysia announced it was shipping 450 tons of imported plastic waste back to its sources, including Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the US.The Philippines, meanwhile, returned about 69 containers of rubbish back to Canada last month, putting an end to a diplomatic row between the two countries.Global concern over plastic pollution has been spurred by shocking images of waste-clogged rivers in Southeast Asia and accounts of dead sea creatures found with kilos of refuse in their stomachs.Around 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year, according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature, with much of it ending up in landfills or polluting the seas, in what has become a growing international crisis.
