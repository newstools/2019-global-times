US President Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) said Tuesday that they raised 105 million US dollars in the second quarter of this year for the president's reelection bid.The large haul comes from the Trump Victory Committee, which is the joint fundraising committee between the campaign and the RNC, according to local media reports.As for their reelection war chest, the Trump campaign reported it had 100 million dollars in cash on hand."No Democrat candidate can match this level of enthusiasm or President Trump's outstanding record of results," said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale."The RNC's record-breaking fundraising has allowed us to identify troves of new supporters online and continue investing in our unprecedented field program," said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. "Our grassroots army is already hard at work - putting us in prime position to re-elect President Trump and Republicans across the country."Trump benefits from being the only major Republican running so far, aside from a long-shot primary challenge mounted by former Massachusetts Governor William Weld. Democrats, by contrast, are running as part of a historically large field and must divvy up the donor base, local analysts say.The Trump campaign did not disclose the number of individual donations, which will be included in the official report set to be filed with the Federal Election Commission by July 15.
