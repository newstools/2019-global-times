In the face of terrorist and extremist threats, Xinjiang has taken a series of measures, including the establishment of education and vocational training centers, which help improve the security in the region,” Geng said.He noted that there has been no violent attack in Xinjiang for more than two years, and local residents’ sense of security and happiness have greatly improved.
