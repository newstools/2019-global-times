Israeli forces began demolishing buildings near a military barrier on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Monday, in the face of Palestinian protests and international criticism.Bulldozers accompanied by hundreds of Israeli soldiers and police moved into Sur Baher, a Palestinian village on the edge of East Jerusalem in an area that ­Israel captured and occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.Palestinians fear that the razing of homes and buildings near the fence will set a precedent for other towns along the route of the barrier, which runs for hundreds of kilometers around and through the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The demolition is the latest round of protracted wrangling over the future of Jerusalem, home to more than 500,000 Israelis and 300,000 Palestinians, and sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and ­Christianity. Israeli forces cut through a wire section of the barrier in Sur Baher under cover of darkness early on Monday, and began clearing residents from the area.Floodlights lit up the area as dozens of vehicles brought helmeted security forces into the village.After first light, mechanical diggers began destroying a two-story house as soldiers moved through several floors of a partly constructed multi-story building nearby."Since 2 am, they have been evacuating people from their homes by force and they have started planting explosives in the homes they want to destroy," said Hamada Hamada, a community leader in Sur Baher.The work was filmed and photographed by Palestinian, Israeli and international activists who had mobilized to try and stop the demolition.Israel's Supreme Court ruled in June that the structures violated a construction ban. The deadline for residents to remove the affected buildings, or parts of them, expired on Friday.Some Sur Baher residents said they would be made homeless. Owners said they had obtained permission to build from the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The sprawling village of Sur Baher straddles the line between East Jerusalem and the West Bank.Its political geography is complicated by the fact that parts of it lie outside the municipal boundaries of Israeli-­occupied East Jerusalem but on the Israeli side of the barrier, cutting it off from the rest of the West Bank.Palestinian officials say some of the threatened structures lie within areas that they should control. The Palestine Liberation Organization issued a statement accusing the Israeli court of aiming "to set a precedent to enable the Israeli occupying forces to demolish numerous Palestinian buildings located in close proximity" to the barrier.
