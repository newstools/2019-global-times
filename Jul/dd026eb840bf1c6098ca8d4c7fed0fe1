The country has maintained stability of its monetary policy, with timely and pre-emptive fine-tuning, and kept the yuan exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level."China's financial sector will further open up, and financial supervision and management will become more and more well-regulated," he said.When talking about difficulties facing private businesses, which contribute more than 80 percent of the country's urban jobs and 60 percent of the country's GDP, Premier Li said the country will work to ensure implementation of tax reduction policies to lower financing costs and make sure enterprises benefit from these policies.
