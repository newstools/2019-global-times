An earthquake of 6.0 magnitude struck off Indonesia's Bali Island earlier on Tuesday but there was no potential for tsunami, the meteorology and geophysics agency said. The quake hit at around 07:18 a.m. Jakarta time, an official in charge of the agency, Wahyu Kurniawan, said. "We did not issue a tsunami warning, as this quake did not have the potential to trigger big waves," he told Xinhua over phone. The quake has only caused minor damages in Nusa Dua so far and there has no immediate report of casualties, said Nyoman Sanjaya, the head of the data and information of disaster management agency in the island. "Tourists rushed out from hotels when the quake occurred but it did not trigger panic," he told Xinhua over phone. An assessment on the impact of the quake has been undertaken, Sanjaya added. Indonesia is frequently hit by earthquakes as it sits on a vulnerable quake-hit zone called "the Pacific Ring of Fire."
