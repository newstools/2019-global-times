China is willing to continue to strengthen communication, coordination and cooperation with the European Union (EU) so as to jointly push for further development of China-EU relations in the new era, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday.Wang made the remarks while meeting press with Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz following their talks.Wang said the change of leadership of the EU institutions is a major event in European politics this year, and China is pleased to see the successful change of the leadership.The world today is undergoing unprecedented transformations. China and Europe, as two important global forces, have important consensus and broad common interests in safeguarding multilateralism and free trade as well as building an open world economy. The two sides, he said, should therefore work together to tackle global challenges, which is of great significance in boosting world multi-polarization, improving global governance and promoting world peace, stability and development.Noting that China regards the EU as a comprehensive strategic partner, not a rival, the Chinese foreign minister said that China will continue to firmly support the European integration process, the EU's unity and growth as well as a more important role Europe plays in international affairs.He added that China hopes and believes the EU institutions under new leaders will also maintain their policies towards China consistent and forwarding-looking.Upholding the principles of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, China is willing to continue to strengthen communication, coordination and cooperation with the EU, deepen mutual trust and make progress so as to jointly push for further development of China-EU relations in the new era, said Wang.
