What I was saying is the way to deal with that violence is not by repression."Hunt previously urged authorities in Hong Kong not to use protests as a pretext for repression, the BBC reported Tuesday. He said he understands the root causes of what happened as people in Hong Kong are concerned that their basic freedoms are under attack.The comments were fiercely refuted by Chinese diplomats and officials, who accused Hunt of "colonial-era delusions" and warned that relations had been "damaged" by his comments.Hung Kam-in, a member of the Kwun Tong District Council in Hong Kong, said "Hunt probably had a daydream when he threatened China over Hong Kong affairs. The UK has neither the legitimacy nor capability to challenge China's sovereignty over Hong Kong."However, Hunt is indirectly delivering a message to a group of people in Hong Kong who violently ruined the Legislative Council (LegCo) by releasing tough words to China, Hung said. "Hunt's remarks sound like he is telling those radical protesters that the UK will stand with them and encourage their vandalism."Some local residents in Hong Kong are also furious about the UK official's comments on the violent protest and the British stance on the issue. A Hong Kong resident surnamed Chan told the Global Times on Friday that Hong Kong-related issues are purely internal affairs and that the UK and the US have no right to intervene. "We oppose this intervention," he said. Also on Thursday afternoon, a middle-aged Hong Kong woman harshly criticized a group of supporters of radical protesters who vandalized the Hong Kong Legislative Counci, particularly after some of them raised the British colonial flag inside the LegCo Monday night.  "I'm Chinese, and I'm proud of being Chinese, if you don't commit to your Chinese citizenship, then get out," the woman told supporters of the violent protesters.

Today it is fourth, accounting for 7.5 percent of all UK trade - a five-fold increase, Telegraph said in a report titled "Jeremy Hunt's China crisis could be bad news for British exports."The UK remains the top European destination for foreign direct investment from China, and China has surged from the 40th to the seventh-biggest export market for UK businesses since 1998, the Telegraph reported.
