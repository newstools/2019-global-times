Online drama The Next Top Star will come to an end on Chinese streaming platform Sohu TV. Debuting on July 4, the 15-episode drama has earned a 7.0./10 on Chinese media review site Douban, while the hashtag for the show has 250 million views on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo.The drama tells the story of entertainers struggling to make it to the top of the entertainment industry and deal with crises in their careers and personal lives. Wei Ziwei, one of the show's producers, told media that real life entertainers can see themselves reflected in the drama, which reveals the hell many stars must go through to reach the top. Even though most viewers do not have such experiences, he feels the controversial plots in the drama can also inspire them to think about the conflicts that often arise between reality and one's dreams.
