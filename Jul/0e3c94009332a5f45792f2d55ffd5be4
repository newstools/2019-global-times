Many people think it's dreaming a little bit because it's so difficult," said Bruce Campbell, director of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).But early tests to improve photosynthesis in tobacco have shown a 40 percent boost in production - and the technique is now being tested with crops from cassava to maize, said Kathy Kahn, a crop research expert with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Nick Austin, who directs agricultural development for the foundation, said such changes "are going to benefit the poor and rich worlds together" - and could play a key role in keeping food prices affordable."These technologies ... are going to be globally relevant," he predicted.Other efforts to help farmers - including the poorest - adapt to climate pressures have already taken root, Khan said.Flood-tolerant rice that can withstand being submerged under water, for instance, is now being used by 6 million farmers in Asia to cope with more extreme weather, she said.But Christensen, of the University of Copenhagen, thinks even more high-tech innovations - from weeding robots to drones - are likely to reach poorer farmers too.With Africa expected to see rapid population growth and movement to cities in coming decades, its farmers will need to become more efficient at producing larger amounts of food, he said."If you want to increase efficiency, you need to use machinery to do some of the hard work," he added.He believes prices for drones and robots will fall rapidly in years to come, just as they once did for mobile phones."Maybe you will share this machinery with your neighbor," Christensen said. "A village of smallholder farmers could think of buying one for all their fields."Two-way flowAs consumers and companies demand to know more about the origin of what they buy, farmers in poorer nations could also adopt systems from blockchain to microchips tucked into cauliflower to help with tracking, said CCAFS principal scientist Philip Thornton.Thornton is working on a Wild Futures report, due out later this year, that will dig into potential high-tech advances and predict how the food system might look in 15-20 years' time, given the pace of technological change, he said.There is still "quite a lot of uncertainty" about how much high-tech innovation will reach poorer small-scale farmers and especially around how quickly that could happen, he added.But CCAFS director Campbell predicted there would be "many innovations, and the innovations are highly likely to be picked up elsewhere" beyond their source.Christensen said ideas also are increasingly flowing from poorer countries to richer ones, not just in the other direction, particularly because the poorest are in some cases dealing with the strongest climate impacts first."There's a lot of inspiration from the people in developing countries," he said. Newspaper headline: Smart farming
