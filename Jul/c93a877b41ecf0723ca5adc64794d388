A high school principal in the southeastern US state of Florida has been removed from his post for denying that the Holocaust was a "factual, historical event" in an email to a parent, the school district said on Monday. William Latson, the principal at Spanish River Community High School at Boca Raton, Florida, apologized after the email exchange from April 2018 came under fire over the weekends. "It is out of an abundance of concern and respect for the students and staff of Spanish River Community High School that school district administration has decided to reassign Principal William Latson effective immediately," the school district of Palm Beach County was quoted by The Palm Beach Postwrote as saying in a statement. "In addition to being offensive," the school district said, "the principal's statement is not supported by either the school district administration or the school board." In a statement to local media, Latson said he regretted "the verbiage" that he used in the email and that it "did not accurately reflect my professional and personal commitment to educating all students about the atrocities of the Holocaust."
