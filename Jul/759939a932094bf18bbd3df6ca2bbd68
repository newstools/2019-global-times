US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday discussed over phone issues concerning Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the White House said. The two leaders discussed the Iran's decision to surpass the limit of the low-grade enriched uranium stockpile under the Iran nuclear deal and Trump's latest meeting with Kim, the White House said in a statement, without offering any details. Macron reportedly said that he was hoping to convince Trump to renew negotiations with Iran. The Trump administration has reimposed various economic sanctions against Iran since its withdrawal of the nuclear deal last year. The Iran nuclear deal was inked by Iran with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United States in 2015, following which Tehran curbed its uranium enrichment capacity to win sanctions relief in return.
