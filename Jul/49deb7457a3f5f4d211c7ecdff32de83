Overseas financial institutions will be encouraged to participate in setting up and investing in the asset management subsidiaries of commercial banks. Meanwhile, overseas asset management agencies will be permitted to co-establish foreign-controlled asset management companies together with subsidiaries of Chinese banks or insurers, said a statement posted on the central bank website.
