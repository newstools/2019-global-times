Defaults help break the system of guaranteed payments and correct faults in the market."They are beneficial for a normal investment culture, a normal price and resources allocation in the bond market," said Pan.The official noted that China will control the amount of bond defaults in 2019, using both legal and market means.Bond defaults increased last year, but were not excessively high, he said.As of the end of 2018, defaulted bonds accounted for 0.79 percent of the total bonds issued, compared with the international level of between 1.12 percent and 2.15 percent in the past few years, Pan said, citing a Moody's report. The PBC released in June a draft on trading of defaulted matured bonds in the interbank market with the goal of improving the trading mechanism and protecting investors' interests. It began a pilot program involving the trading of defaulted bonds on the interbank market in the second half of 2018.China has sought in recent years to allow foreign investors wider access to the fast-growing domestic bond market, including encouraging issuance of panda bonds - yuan-denominated debt - by foreign entities in China.As of the end of last year, China's bond market stood at 86 trillion yuan, ranking third in the world, with international investors holding 1.8 trillion yuan, up 46 percent year-on-year, Pan said in a high-level meeting in January.In April, Bloomberg began adding yuan-denominated Chinese government and policy bank bonds to its Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index.Newspaper headline: Rising defaults in bond market normal and controllable: experts
