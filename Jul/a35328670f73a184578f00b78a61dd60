In April, its shipments to China surged 61.3 percent year-on-year, as demand in China rose and Australia itself expanded its LNG export capacity."Australian LNG shipments to China will face a very big challenge when the Russian pipelines begin to channel gas," Jin told the Global Times on Wednesday.LNG needs costly special-purpose vessels for transportation and the number of receiving facilities, which are also expensive, is limited in China, according to Jin. "With this natural cost advantage over LNG, if the price of the Russia-China natural gas deal is reasonable, then pipeline gas will squeeze the LNG market," Jin said.In 2014, Russia and China signed a $400 billion deal on the supply of 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas over a period of 30 years.China is the world's top importer of natural gas and second-largest buyer of LNG after having surpassed South Korea in 2017.A total of 46.92 million tons of natural gas were imported in the first half of this year, up 11.6 percent from one year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Friday.China's key sources for LNG are in Southeast Asia, Australia and Qatar.For pipeline gas, China has currently two arteries channeling gas from Turkmenistan and Myanmar to feed its natural gas demand. "The world's major consumption market for LNG is limited. With three pipelines in place and functioning, China's growing demand for natural gas can be met," Jin said.Newspaper headline: Increased gas imports from Russia could extinguish Australia’s LNG exports
