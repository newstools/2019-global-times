Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has called for more efforts to maintain steady and healthy development of the economy and society. The Chinese economy has achieved generally steady performance in the first half of this year with residents' income increasing, the ecological environment improving and some indicators beating expectations, which did not come by easily, Li made the remarks Monday while chairing a symposium attended by economists and entrepreneurs to analyze economic situation. However, the downward pressure is increasing due to weak global economic recovery, slowing trade and investment, rising protectionism and other headwinds facing the domestic economy, Li pointed out. The country's GDP expanded 6.3 percent in the first six months of this year, in line with the government's annual target of 6-6.5 percent, official data showed Monday.
