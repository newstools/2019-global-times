Thus, research on newly discovered rays would also help scientists to develop protection tools to better help astronauts avoid radiation from cosmic rays.Experts believe that the gamma rays come from the Crab Nebula, which is a supernova remnant in the constellation Taurus and is about 6,500 light years away from Earth. The Crab Nebula was produced by a supernova explosion, which was recorded in 1054 in official historical documents of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127).In 1969, scientists discovered a pulsar, rotating 30 times per second, embedded in the nebula. In the modern era, the Crab Nebula has been observed at all electromagnetic wavelengths ranging from radio to very high energy gamma rays.The Tibet ASgamma experiment, located in Yangbajing at an altitude of 4,300 meters, was jointly launched in 1990 by China and Japan. Experts said that Tibet is ideal for research about rays from outer space because of its high altitude.To catch gamma rays with high energy, experts put a new detector 2.5 meters underground in 2014 to rule out 99.92 percent of non-gamma rays, significantly improving the sensitivity.Newspaper headline: Highest-energy gamma rays detected
