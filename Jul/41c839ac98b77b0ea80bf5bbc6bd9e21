Those who have not registered online can discard their rubbish by pressing a button on the trash bin, according to a video from the China Internet Development Foundation on Saturday. Users can also earn points if they sort their garbage successfully, and these points can be exchanged for daily necessities. In addition, foldable recyclable garbage can be converted into money after being weighed. Waste in the community is divided into six categories - kitchen waste, metal, textiles, paper, plastics, and other waste, according to the video. Pear Video
