Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Monday that Iran's low-grade enriched uranium stockpile has exceeded 300 kg, official IRNA news agency reported."According to my information, Iran has surpassed 300 kg (in the stockpile of enriched uranium) as we had already announced," Zarif was quoted as saying.Zarif made the remarks in the central Iranian city of Natanz which is home to parts of Iran's nuclear facilities.He also blamed the European signatories of the Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, for their "insufficient" measures to ensure Iran's benefit from the accord after the U.S. exit in May 2018."European measures have not been enough and as Iran has announced, we will carry out the second phase of reducing commitments," Zarif was quoted as saying.On May 8, Iran withdrew from implementing part of the nuclear deal and threatened to take more actions in case Tehran's interests under the pact cannot be guaranteed.Iran will "decisively" start the second phase of freezing its obligations from July 7, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said on June 25.Iran has said it will re-embrace its obligations pertaining to the nuclear pact if the Europeans honor their commitments.
