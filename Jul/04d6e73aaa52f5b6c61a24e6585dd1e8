Chen Tongdu, the head of the UK Hanban office, told the Global Times that more than 3,000 pupils are already involved in the program.Li Guoqiang, first secretary of the Education Office of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, said that the embassy will continue to support the professional development of local Chinese teachers.

Through lectures, teaching workshops and discussion groups, the training covers basic Chinese teaching, the use of Chinese textbooks, the introduction of teaching resources at the Confucius Institute Headquarters and Chinese language tests.Xia Wei, a Mandarin teacher from Northern Ireland, said the two-day training program enriched her teaching skills and enabled her to face new challenges in the classroom.Professor Yuan Shaofeng with the Central University of Finance and Economics told the Global Times that she was impressed with the passion and expertise of the local teachers.
