It also shows that Turkey's foreign policy is in the process of transformation and is now trying to strike a balance between the East and the West," said Zhu."China has the conditions and the ability to cooperate with Turkey on a broader and deeper level, but the cooperation must be based on political mutual trust, which requires that they reach a consensus on each other's major concerns," Zhu noted.The Chinese president positioned Turkey as an important partner in the Belt and Road cooperation, proposing that China and Turkey should work jointly to accelerate the integration of Turkey's "Middle Corridor" project with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Erdogan said that Turkey strongly supports the construction of the BRI and hopes the two sides will strengthen cooperation in sectors including trade, infrastructure, 5G, and smart cities under the framework of BRI. Turkey is against any form of trade war  and any kind of protectionism, Turkish diplomatic sources told the Global Times on Tuesday.
