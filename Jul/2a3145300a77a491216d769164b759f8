To prevent the devastating fire like the one damaging the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in April, China's National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA), together with related fire and rescue departments, has kicked off a campaign against fire hazards threatening cultural relics in the country.  Learning lessons from the fire that destroyed the National Museum of Brazil in September 2018, China launched in 2018 the first round of a national-wide campaign to ferret out fire hazards. More than 70,000 museums and cultural institutions were inspected, more than 100,000 fire hazards found, and over 90,000 potential risks were rectified in 2018, said NCHA on Tursday.According to the administration, the campaign this year runs from July to mid-September, and the scope of the investigation covers non-movable cultural relics that are potential fire risks, cultural relic collection institutions including museums and memorial halls at all levels and construction sites for heritage protection projects. Fire hazards and problems such as electrical failure, burning incense, management of hazardous substances, conditions of facilities and equipment and fire control safety management are among the key targets of rectification, noted NCHA. Electrical failures were the biggest cause of fires in museums, accounting for 43 percent, according to data provided by NCHA. The institution is also looking to raise cultural relic protection awareness, improve protection systems, strengthen the construction of fire control infrastructure, and improve the capacity for emergency responses.
