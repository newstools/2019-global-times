It has to strengthen its core competence to open the upscale market and keep growing," Jin Baisong, an independent economist based in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday.Chinese companies are expected to deeply integrate their operations into global value chains to increase sustainable development competitiveness, said Jin. "Huawei is a good example. The company has grown very quickly by building global value chains, while competing globally in accordance with internationally accepted rules," Jin said.Huawei rose to No.61 on the list from No.72 last year.Chinese and US companies on the list are mainly in five industries - energy and mining, commercial trade, banking, insurance and aerospace/defense.Many Chinese private companies also have large growth potential. Six out of the 10 companies that reported fastest growth in the ranking are Chinese companies, including property developer Country Garden, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and retail giant Suning.More and more Chinese companies got on the top 500 list because of their rapid growth, but we shouldn't get too excited - quality is more important than quantity, Jin said.Chinese companies' revenue accounted for 25.6 percent of the Global 500 total, behind 28.8 percent for the US. Newspaper headline: Nation overtakes US on global business ranking
