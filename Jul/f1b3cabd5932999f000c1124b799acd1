After the launch of Shenzhou-11, the spacecraft docked two days later with China's first space lab, Tiangong-2, where the two astronauts lived for 30 days. The two astronauts who completed China's longest-ever manned space mission returned to Earth safely on November 18, 2016.

It successfully tested refueling and the 30-day stay of Chinese astronauts, the longest in China's manned space exploration history. Tiangong-2 accommodated two astronauts for 30 days in 2016 and hosted a series of cutting-edge science experiments, such as quantum key distribution, a cold atomic clock and gamma ray burst observation."Tiangong-2's voluntary retirement is meant to eliminate all risks," Zhu said, "otherwise, the in-orbit reliability of the space lab will decline as the extended service stretches further longer than it was originally intended. And once some anomalies occur, Tiangong-2 would uncontrollably fall back to the atmosphere, and some parts might not be completely burned, with its debris falling to the ground, posing a threat to people."To make sure the controlled de-orbit took place in a designated time and location, and to ensure the security of the ground, Tiangong-2 took a two-step strategy for its controlled de-orbit: first, lower the space lab to an elliptical orbit of 200 kilometers, then, second, descend it to an elliptical orbit of 70 kilometers before its re-entry to the atmosphere, Zhu said.Fourteen cutting-edge experiments covering physics, space science and applications had been conducted, and the space lab carried as many as 51 payloads weighing over 600 kilograms, according to a statement the China Manned Space Engineering Office released in September 2018.

Its lander and Yutu-2 made the first-ever soft-landing on the far side of the moon on January 3.China also has a busy schedule for other space activities. It will send more than 50 craft into space via over 30 launches this year, including the launch of the Long March-5 carrier rocket and the Chang'e-5 lunar probe.During the process, China has never been reluctant to share opportunities brought by its scientific and technological achievements, hoping to contribute to the building of a community with a shared future.Recently, China announced with the United Nations nine international science experiments that will be conducted on its planned space station.The Chinese Academy of Sciences has provided more than 1.8 billion yuan ($268 million) for science and technology projects in association with the Belt and Road Initiative since 2013, benefiting many Asian and African countries.The development of China's space exploration also comes with public enthusiasm, especially the young generation, as the country's astronauts and space organizations are exploring innovative ways to interact with the public.During the summer vacation, space-themed exhibits and activities are being held across China. The Xinhua News Agency reported that over 310 million visits were made to more than 21,000 science popularization events during the week.Before the re-entry of the Tiangong-2 space lab into atmosphere, many Chinese net users said "welcome home" to the Sina Weibo account of the space lab, which has over 382,000 followers. "Mission accomplished and welcome home. Thanks for taking us one step closer to the era of the space station," wrote Weibo user "Kejikong."Newspaper headline: Tiangong-2 successfully, safely re-enters atmosphere
