Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies reported an amazingly rosy financial performance for the first half year of 2019, despite facing harsh sanctions from the Trump administration to destroy the global 5G leader. The company reported 401.3 billion yuan ($58.3 billion) revenue for the first six months, rising 23.2 percent year-on-year. Net profit for the same period rose 8.7 percent, Huawei said on Tuesday while releasing its half-year financial results at Shenzhen, Guangdong Province.The growth rate beat most market expectations and showed that the US government sanctions failed to thwart the health of China's most well-known technology firm, Chinese analysts said.In breakdown, Huawei's major business branches have all maintained resilient growth. Its consumer business or digital devices business, the biggest contributor to the company's overall revenue in 2018, has seen solid growth, with 118 million smartphones shipped in the first half of 2019, up 24 percent year-on-year."Revenue grew fast through May," said Liang Hua, Chairman of Huawei. "Given the foundation we laid in the first half of the year, we continued to see business growth after we were added to the (US government) Entity List. That's not to say we don't have difficulties. We do, but they only affect the pace of our growth in the short term."The US government blacklisting Huawei in middle May has had some impact on Huawei's growth, but both the scope and extent of the negative impact are controllable. Huawei's core products have not been significantly affected, Liang said.Fu Liang, a Beijing-based independent ICT industry analyst, told the Global Times that although Huawei's overseas shipments have been impacted by the US sanctions, Huawei's phone sales in China surged momentously over the past year, contributing to its stellar revenue growth.According to a report by Canalys, a multinational industry firm, Huawei shipped 37.3 million smartphones at home in the second quarter of 2019, surging 31 percent year-on-year, and took a market share of 38.2 percent in China, the highest market share achieved by any phone vendor in the past eight years. Its carrier or wireless network business also withstood US attack and registered impressive growth. Huawei has secured more than 50 commercial 5G contracts, and has shipped more than 150,000 5G base stations to telecom operators around the world, the company said. Fu said that Huawei's performance in the first half year showed that the company has formed "a strong business operation system, which effectively helps it stave off market risks and realize nonstop revenue growth.Huawei has been facing extreme pressure over the past months amid the relentless US attack in middle May, which strictly restricted a slew of US firms like Qualcomm, Intel and Google from selling key software and parts to Huawei.Trump administration said it will allow US companies to resume supplies to Huawei on the condition that the sale does not pose any national security threat, uncertainty remains for the company now. Whether or not Huawei will be removed from the US's Entity List is unclear, which continues to cast a shadow over its business.Huawei should continue to reduce its reliance on US supplies in the coming months and invest more resources on research and development and prevail with key technology breakthroughs, Fu said.Huawei's self-developed HongMeng operating system and its advanced chipsets including the new 7nm chipset Kirin 810 will help it withstand further pressure, experts say.
