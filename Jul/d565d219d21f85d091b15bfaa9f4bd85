"This shows China's space technologies are becoming mature, and its application is also expanding, contributing to the development of the national economy," Yu said.Another achievement is the high resolution earth observation system, or Gaofen satellites project that was initiated in 2010, Yu noted.Gaofen satellites have been widely used by more than 20 industries in 30 provinces and regions, playing important roles in environment protection, forestry, agriculture and mapping, chinanews.com reported.By the end of this year, the Gaofen-7 satellite will be launched, which will mark the completion of the Gaofen system. The focus will then shift to the practical use of the system, Yu said.Global Times
