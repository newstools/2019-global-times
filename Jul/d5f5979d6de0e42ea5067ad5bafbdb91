Together they contributed to the decline in drug users in China, he said.The number of Chinese drug users was 0.18 percent of the population in 2018, a drop for the first time in history, according to a report released on June 17 by the commission. The General Administration of Customs revealed in June that Chinese customs cracked 604 drug smuggling cases in 2018, seizing 37.5 tons of drugs and precursor chemicals, representing a three-year consecutive drop in the number of drug cases. In June, Chinese police in Wuhan, Hubei teamed up with Myanmar police to crack a large drug trafficking ring which had disguised drugs including heroin and crystal meth as "tea bricks" and smuggled them from Myanmar to Hubei via the border province of Yunnan, with over 100 people arrested and 267 kilograms of drugs seized, Xinhua reported.
