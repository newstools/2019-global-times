Photo: VCGA private survey on Wednesday showed that growth in China's services sector slowed to a four-month low in June, due to the decreasing number of new export orders amid sluggish global trading conditions.The Caixin General Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a main gauge of activity at services companies, remained in expansion territory though it slipped to 52 in June, 0.7 points lower than the previous month, according to a statement from Caixin. New export orders for services fell for the first time in nine months, said Caixin, adding that continuous weak external demand and rising tariffs are causing the decrease.Experts noted that the decline reflected downward external and internal pressure on China's economy, but the sector will likely rebound thanks to the easing of US-China trade tensions. "Since China and the US have reached a trade war truce, things are going to be different," Li Youhuan, a senior economist at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.China has taken many steps to boost its economy, including tax and fee reductions and business environment improvements. These measures have already stimulated the domestic market to some extent, although their impact has been offset by rising tariffs, Li noted."External pressures have eased, along with existing positive internal policy incentives, so the economic data will soon recover," Li said.Top leaders from China and the US reached an agreement during the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, to restart their trade consultations, and the US said it will not impose new tariffs on imports from China, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Saturday.The Caixin Manufacturing PMI, which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises, stood at 49.4 in June. A below-50 PMI suggests economic contraction, while an above-50 level points to economic expansion.Newspaper headline: Tertiary sector continues expansion in June amid pressure
