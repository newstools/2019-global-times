A major exhibition featuring Tibetan heritage is to be held at the Meridian Gate Gallery of the Palace Museum in Beijing in December, China Daily reported Wednesday. More than 200 Tibetan cultural relics will be showcased during the three-month exhibition, Wang Xudong, curator of the Palace Museum, was quoted as saying. As the best evidence of historical memories, these legacies left by ancient people can reflect the close connection between the central government and Tibet in history, Wang said. The exchange of cultural relics collections will also boost communications between Tibet and other places in China, Wang said.
