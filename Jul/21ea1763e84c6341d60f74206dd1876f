Chinese President Xi Jinping's special envoy Yang Chuantang on Monday attended the inauguration ceremony for President David W. Panuelo of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). During his meeting with Panuelo, Yang, also vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, conveyed Xi's sincere greetings to Panuelo. China is ready to take this year's 30th anniversary of the establishment of China-FSM diplomatic relations as an opportunity to work with the FSM to implement the important consensus reached by leaders of the two countries, Yang said. China, Yang said, is ready to work with the FSM to maintain high-level contacts and exchanges at all levels and expand pragmatic cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. Yang said China and the FSM should strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges, raise the China-FSM comprehensive strategic partnership featuring mutual respect and common development to new heights, and work together to build a community with a shared future for humanity. Panuelo asked Yang to convey his best wishes to Xi, saying that the FSM is grateful for China's valuable support for its sustainable development. Panuelo said the FSM will firmly adhere to the one-China policy, deepen the two countries' traditional friendship and all-round cooperation, and lift FSM-China relations to a new level over the next 30 years. On the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony, Yang also met with Wesley Simina, speaker of Congress of the FSM, and other leaders of the country.
