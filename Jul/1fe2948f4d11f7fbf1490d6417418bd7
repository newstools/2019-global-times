Libyan authorities on Saturday released an unlicensed Italian fishing boat seized last week off Libyan coast, Libyan navy spokesman said. "The Italian fishing boat was released in accordance with Libyan law. The fishing equipment has been confiscated and the crew pledged not to illegally fish (in Libyan waters) in the future," navy spokesman Ayob Qassem told Xinhua. "We dealt with the Italian boat the same way we deal with other illegal boats seized. Seized boats pledge not to repeat such act in the national waters. If they violate rules again, the crew would be referred to the Attorney General, and get fined," the spokesman added. On Wednesday, Libyan authorities announced seizing an unlicensed Italian fishing boat off Libyan coast, with five Italians and two Tunisians on board. The boat was taken to Misurata sea port, some 200 km east of the capital Tripoli. Libyan authorities have announced seizing unlicensed bulldozers and fishing boats off the Libyan coast.
