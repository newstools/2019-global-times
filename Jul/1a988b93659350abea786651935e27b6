The project will supply 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year in the near future. When asked about how this overland pipeline gas increase will affect China's liquefied natural gas (LNG) import ports, Dale said that the pipeline gas could displace some LNG, although a relatively small amount."Relative to total energy imports, [inflows from this new project] are relatively small. They won't affect the big picture," Dale noted. Overall, China may still have to import very significant amounts of LNG as well, Dale said.China remains the world's largest energy consuming country, accounting for 24 percent of world energy use and 34 percent of new consumption demand for 2018, the review showed.China, India and emerging Asia will continue to need more energy to fuel their growth in the years to come, according to Dale.Newspaper headline: Nation must address gas infrastructure: BP
