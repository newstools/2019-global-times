A pair of handcuffs. Photo: ICCrime-busting police in Southwest China were stumped by a pair of handcuffs that just wouldn't open and were forced to finally call on firefighters to crack the case. After bringing a suspected criminal to the police station for questioning, police officers in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province could not open the handcuffs holding the man. The apparently red-faced cops finally called in reinforcements: local firefighters, Pear Video reported on Monday.The firefighters arrived with a long bolt cutter, and within five minutes, the suspect who was behind bars was released from his shackles.The handcuffs were "of good quality," said a firefighter noting the force it required to snap them open. Obviously the lock was not up to standard, or perhaps the wrong key was being used. Firefighters in China not only put out fires, they are also responsible for taking care of other odd and challenging problems encountered by local residents. Recent reports show they were tasked with removing a hornets nest from a tenant's balcony, saved numerous pets from perilous situations and helped release a child who was stuck in a fence.Pear Video
