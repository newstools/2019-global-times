And the Hong Kong police have made great efforts to maintain law and order and sacrificed a lot amid recent riots, Yang Guang, a spokesperson of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said on Monday.  Hong Kong society has staged large rallies to defend Hong Kong, calling for the rule of law and denouncing violence, which represents the mainstream public opinion of Hong Kong society, Yang said. The central government firmly supports the Hong Kong police to hold the rioters accountable and restore social order as soon as possible.He proposed that Hong Kong people should reject violence and condemn radical protests, which have seriously hurt the fundamentals of the city’s prosperity. Hong Kong society should figure their way out of these continuing political debates to focus on developing Hong Kong’s economy and improving people’s lives, the spokesperson called. He also noted that the central government will continue to unswervingly implement the policy of "one country, two systems," and will not change or waver in its implementation. The official presented three bottom lines for the implementation of the “one country, two systems” policy--it should never endanger national sovereignty, never allow challenges to the authority of the central government and the Basic Law of Hong Kong and never allow the use of Hong Kong to harm the mainland.The central government will continue to support Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to govern the region under the rule of law, unite and lead all walks of life in the city to jointly safeguard political stability and prosperity. Global Times
