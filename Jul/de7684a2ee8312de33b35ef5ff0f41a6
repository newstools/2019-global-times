The US government has granted clearance for Chinese drone manufacturer DJI's high-security "Government Edition" drones, the company confirmed with the Global Times on Wednesday.Users of DJI drones will have full control over the collection, storage and transmission of data generated by the drones, the company said.Regular versions of DJI drones can connect to the internet to update local maps, enhance user experience and safety and data transfer needs, while the company's Government Edition drones ensure the data they collect cannot be intentionally or unintentionally shared, the company noted.The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday that the US Department of the Interior gave clearance to the company's high-security Government Edition drones. The department is responsible for evaluating and approving drone technology for use across a wide range of applications.In May, the US Department of Homeland Security issued an alert claiming Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to Chinese manufacturers, which could then be obtained by the Chinese government, CNN reported.DJI unveiled its Government Edition drone in June, and aims to meet increasing demand from the US market, DJI told the Global Times previously.DJI approached the US Interior Department in 2017 to collaborate on creating and testing drones deemed safe by the US, and the department found no indication that data was being transmitted outside the system after 15 months of testing, according to the South China Morning Post report.Wang Huicong and Liu Xuanzun contributed to this story
