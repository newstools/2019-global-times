The center records the athletes' photos into a face recognition recording system beforehand and distinguishes the athletes during the games. "Facial recognition has rarely been used in aquatics in China before. The recording system can easily acquire the athletes' personal information and connect it with their records and performances during the games," said Ren Kaiyun, director of the national Fitness Guidance Center to Taiyuan, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Besides technologies, environmental improvement and protection has also been a main characteristic of the preparation for the Second Youth Games. For example, the Shanxi extreme sports center, which will be used as the venue for extreme sports competitions during the games, was built on wasteland, and the Ao Shen sports park for soccer matches was built in an area that used to be a coal ash landfill. "We have done our best to make sure the Second Youth Games are economically and eco-friendly, and have built the stadiums in different parts the province so as to engage more people in the event," Liu Qingzao, secretary-general assistant of the organizing committee, told the Global Times on Tuesday."This is the first time that Shanxi has ever organized such a national multi-sports event, and it's also the first time that both summer and winter sports (such as skating, skiing, curling, ice hockey, and biathlon) will be carried out in the same province," Liu added. The Chinese Youth Games is held every four years to improve the performance of China's best young athletes and promote widespread involvement in sports.
