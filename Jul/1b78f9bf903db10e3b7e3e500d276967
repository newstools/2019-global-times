Skyrizon would own more than 50 percent of Motor Sich if the acquisition works, read the note. China has 13 types and more than 1,200 aircraft engines built by Motor Sich, the note said.But the US is unhappy about Motor Sich's dealings with China, saying there might be national security risks from foreign investment transactions, the Washington Post reported in May.The Ukrainian company lost its Russian clients when relations between the two countries broke down, according to the report.Established in 1907, Motor Sich is considered one of the largest advanced aircraft engine manufacturers in the world and produces engines including turbofans, turboshafts and turboprops.China still lags behind the world's top level in aeroengines, an anonymous military expert told the Global Times on Sunday.China could close the gap on the foreign aeroengine industry and boost its domestic aeroengine supply if the acquisition becomes successful, the company note said.China is also independently progressing with its own aeroengine development plan, the expert said.A Chinese J-10B fighter jet performed with a homemade engine with thrust vector control system at Airshow China in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in November 2018.Newspaper headline: Chinese firm to buy aeroengine giant
