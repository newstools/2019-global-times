"But Amazon does not have advantages when it comes to non-book sales compared with JD.com or taobao.com," the insider said.Amazon made its foray into the Chinese market after taking over Joyo.com, a popular online seller of books, for $75 million in 2004, when China's e-commerce business had just sprouted.At that time, Alibaba's taobao.com annual sales were only 1 billion yuan ($145 million) compared with Amazon's $7 billion, media reports said.Meanwhile, Amazon's market share in China slid to 0.6 percent, according to data released last year by Analysys, an internet data analysis service provider.
