Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang (Photo source: fmprc.gov.cn)China urged the Prague municipal administration of the Czech Republic and certain politicians to change course and stop undermining China-Czech relations, to avoid hurting their own interests.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang made the remarks Wednesday at a media briefing, in response to a question whether China has taken countermeasures against anti-China activities of the Prague government and mayor.  Geng said that the Prague municipality and the mayor of Prague behaved badly on issues concerning China's core interests and sovereignty related to Taiwan, Tibet Autonomous Region and others. "This seriously hurts Chinese people's feelings and sabotages the benign atmosphere of sub-national exchanges and cooperation of the two countries. This is the fundamental reason why Prague parties and certain people are not welcome by Chinese people," Geng told the media.Prague mayor Zdenek Hrib previously refused to expel a Taiwan "diplomat" and refused to recognize the one-China principle. In March, his administration flew the flag used by the 14th Dalai Lama's "government-in-exile" from Prague's town hall. Hrib also hosted head of the "government-in-exile" Lobsang Sangay, according to the South China Morning Post.
