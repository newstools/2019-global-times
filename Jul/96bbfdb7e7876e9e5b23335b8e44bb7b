Doctors could also communicate in real time.The technology enables patients who live in areas with insufficient medical care to enjoy good medical resources. The application of 5G will further promote remote medical services.The transmission speed of 5G network is 10 to 20 times faster than 4G, and there is only a few milliseconds of delay, while the delay for 4G is tens of milliseconds.The Jiangsu Province Hospital also did a remote lung surgery on a patient in May using 5G and Mixed Reality (MR) technology. Global Times
