That's unlike in the past when a project could be workable in both markets," said Lee.Enterprises are affected by the special circumstances. For example, they may make other choices when going overseas, opting for Southeast Asian countries instead of the US. Investors have become more cautious, especially in core technologies such as chipsets and big data in education and medical care, which might be more appropriate for yuan-denominated VC funds to tap into.The VC firm is betting on the Southeast Asian market, which is a "battleground that capital is bound to seize," according to Lee.She said the current investment phase in Southeast Asia when it comes to technology, media and telecoms is similar to China's situation four to five years ago. "In general, the market is increasingly globalized and going mobile is becoming popular, but services have not caught up. They are looking at China's template to generate a super app."In the next five to 10 years, there will be fiercer competition in Southeast Asian markets as various funds come in, she noted.Newspaper headline: Nation to have more vibrant start-up climate while SE Asia becomes ‘battleground’
