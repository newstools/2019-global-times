The action plan details 100 concrete measures in nine major fields.The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched in November 2014 and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect was established in 2016. The links were created to improve the regulated trading environment and to open up Chinese markets to global investors.
