The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Tuesday voiced shock, indignation and strong condemnation over the violent acts of storming the Legislative Council (LegCo) Complex that took place on Monday. The liaison office said it supports the HKSAR government in thoroughly investigating relevant serious illegal activities. Some ultra-radicals stormed the LegCo Complex in an extremely violent manner and conducted lawless acts that caused mass destruction, which was shocking, distressing and infuriating, an official in charge of the liaison office said. The official said the atrocities extremely provoked and trampled on the rule of law in Hong Kong and seriously undermined the social stability, which could never be tolerated. The liaison office supports the HKSAR government in investigating relevant violent acts in accordance with the law, firmly upholding the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, and working with people from all walks of life to safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, according to the official.
