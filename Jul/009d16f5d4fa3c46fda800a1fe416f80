Other suppliers come from countries including the US (40), Japan (39), South Korea (14), Germany (six) and Singapore (three).For instance, Jilin Liyuan Precision Manufacturing Co, which was newly added to Apple's supplier list in 2019, provides shells for Apple's laptops, according to media reports.Thanks to comprehensive advantages, Chinese industry chains remain attractive and cannot be replaced by those in other countries, Chu Shijia, an official from the Ministry of Commerce, said in early July.China has a complete range of industries and mature infrastructure and there are 170 million workers with higher education or professional skills. It also has a market of 1.4 billion people, and 400 million of them are ranked as middle-class consumers, Chu said. It also has a market of 1.4 billion people, and 400 million of them are ranked as middle-class consumers, according to Chu.Experts said Apple's woes in the Chinese market would continue if the company cannot offer innovative products to lure domestic consumers who can choose local brands.Apple's Chinese users are being lost to to Huawei, said a report by QuestMobile, a data analytical platform, domestic news site pedaily.cn reported. Huawei shipped the largest number of smartphones in the Chinese market with a 34 percent share in the first quarter, while Apple accounted for 9 percent, showed data from the global industry consultancy Counterpoint Research. Apple will unveil three new iPhone 11 models this autumn, technology site 9to5mac.com reported Wednesday.
