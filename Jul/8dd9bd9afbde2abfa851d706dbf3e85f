The National Library of China has released the third batch of Chinese classic books, under its project to offer more reader-friendly editions of the classic canons and literature. The newly-published books include Confucian classic "Xunzi," ancient poetry anthology "Chu Ci" as well as other works on traditional Chinese philosophy, history and politics, annotated by top scholars and experts in the field. So far, the compilation project has published 20 classic books and is expected to publish another 10 at the end of this year. In 2016, the project was initiated to build a catalog of books that could manifest the diversity and history of traditional Chinese culture, with the first batch of 10 books, including classic works of Confucianism and Taoism, published in 2017.
