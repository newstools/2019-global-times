A copy of a famous Chinese fresco is on display in the art museum of Shijiazhuang, capital of North China's Hebei Province on Saturday, and will be donated to a county in the province after the exhibition.The fresco of three bodhisattvas was painted by monks from Mount Wutai, a renowned Buddhist mountain in North China's Shanxi Province, during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).The original fresco used to be kept in the former Qingliang Monastery in Xingtang county and was lost overseas after being divided into 12 pieces in the 1920s. It is now preserved at the British Museum in London and is one of the largest and tallest mural paintings among the museum's collections.In 2017, Hao Jianwen, an expert from the Hebei provincial museum, and his team spent several months copying the fresco. The copy is four meters high and 3.9 meters wide, which is close to a square, the same size as the original piece.Hao and his team decided to donate the copy to Xingtang county and the copy will be put on permanent display there next year.
