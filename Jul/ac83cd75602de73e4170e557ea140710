The monarch turned 73 on July 15, 2019, and he is the world's second longest-reigning present-day monarch after Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. One of the more unique features of this event is the chance for the local people to personally hand out letters to the Sultan, without going through bureaucratic channels, often voicing their daily grievances and hardships. The meet-and-greet event was held in the Brunei-Muara District, the sultanate's main administrative district. Prior to this, similar meet-and-greet ceremonies were held in the other three districts of Belait, Temburong and Tutong. During the meet-and-greet event, the people were divided into several camps, comprising of mukims (administrative divisions of each district), villages, clubs and organizations, government agencies, and private sectors.
