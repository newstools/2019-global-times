Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam on Tuesday appealed for the whole society to have confidence in Hong Kong, saying the HKSAR government will introduce measures to cope with economic downside risks. Lam hosted a luncheon for representatives of international and local chambers of commerce on Tuesday at the Government House on Hong Kong's challenges and opportunities with a view to formulating policy measures that would better meet the needs of the business community in the upcoming policy address. She said due to uncertainties in the external environment, Hong Kong's economic momentum has weakened in recent months, with only a modest growth of 0.6 percent in the first quarter of this year and no room for optimism for the second quarter and the entire year. The HKSAR government has been closely monitoring the global and local economic situations and maintaining close contact with the business community, including numerous local small and medium enterprises, to understand their needs, she said, adding that the HKSAR government will introduce measures in a timely manner to help companies cope with the economic downside risks. Lam said the disputes in society in recent months are not conducive to Hong Kong's continued development and that she would spare no efforts to deal with them. Emphasizing that the rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's success and violence is not a solution to any problem, she hoped that various sectors would jointly uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong, adding that everyone should continue to have confidence in Hong Kong. She firmly believed that with the concerted efforts of various sectors, Hong Kong would find opportunities amid difficulties.
