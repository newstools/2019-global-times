Like the great travelers for the 18th century, you go into the unknown, not knowing what you will find," he said."I am not someone who invades a country to steal things, I am looking for a dialogue," he added."I can't speak for others, but when someone invites you to their table for dinner you have to respect their rules. It is normal that I respect the local culture and not abuse it."Haute couture is the very pinnacle of fashion, with only an elite band of designers allowed to show their luxurious handmade creations in the French capital, some of which cost tens of thousands of euros (dollars).Newspaper headline: Couturier unleashes ‘Resplandor’
