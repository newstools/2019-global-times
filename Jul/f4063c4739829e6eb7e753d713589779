Chinese technology giant Huawei launched Kunpeng industrial ecosystem base and supercomputing center in Xiamen, Southeast China's Fujian Province, which will provide computing services for local governments and major local state-owned enterprises using Huawei chips and operating systems.The Kunpeng ecosystem base will be based on a safe and reliable software and hardware development platform of Huawei, and aims to foster an industrial ecosystem and attract partners to cooperate in the development of a series of products, Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday.Huawei announced an investment of 3 billion yuan ($436 million) in the next five years on its ARM-based server CPU Kunpeng to enrich its own ecosystem, Xu Zhijun, rotating chair of Huawei, told an industry conference on July 23.Based on the Kunpeng CPU, Huawei plans to join hands with partners in the ecosystem to offer IT infrastructure and industrial applications to various industries, including big data platforms and cloud services, reported by stock.stcn.com on July 24.Relying on the products and services independently developed by Huawei, the supercomputing center will use servers with Kunpeng CPU as the core, and introduce a domestic operating system and database system to provide end-to-end computing services for governments, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in Xiamen, said Xinhua.The supercomputing center project is expected to cost 1.5 billion yuan, according to the report.Against the backdrop of US' tightening restrictions on Chinese technological companies, many "countries have realized the importance of technological independence," Xin Haiguang, a Beijing-based IT industry analyst, told the Global Times on Monday."To realize technological independence, it is not enough to just pursue a technology-leading position. Fostering a sound ecosystem is ever more important," Xin said.Xin further noted forming an industrial ecosystem takes enormous work and needs support from every link in the industrial chain. "With the firm support of governments, the Kunpeng ecological base could achieve great success within five years, if it goes well," he said.The launching of the Kunpeng industrial ecosystem base will promote the city's advanced manufacturing and information industries, local news outlet the Xiamen Daily reported on Monday.Through this cooperation, Xiamen could continue to cultivate domestic industrial ecosystem and local talent, and accelerate the development of key industries, said the report.
