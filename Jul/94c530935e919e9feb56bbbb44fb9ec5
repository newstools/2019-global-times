The Pulitzer Prize winner "Doubt, A Parable" will hit the stage at the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center starting July 18, a ticketing center assigned by the theater said Thursday. Premiered in 2004 at an off-Broadway theater, the drama was later transferred to the Walter Kerr Theater on Broadway with 525 performances within one year before its close in 2006, winning the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Award for Best Play. "Doubt, A Parable," by American playwright John Patrick Shanley, is set in a Catholic school of New York in the 1960s, when the United States was in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. It focuses on the conflict between the school's principal represented by the suspicious and conservative Sister Aloysius and the more doctrinally flexible Father Flynn. Touching on the underbelly of the Catholic Church, race, sexuality and gender, the drama cleverly avoids unveiling the whole truth and provokes the audience to dwell upon the story long after the curtains are drawn, some media outlets commented.
