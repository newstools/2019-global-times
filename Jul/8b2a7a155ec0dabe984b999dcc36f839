The Trade war had some negative impact on the process," Liu said.Since the middle of 2018, the yuan's value against the US dollar has generally trended downward. It was traded at nearly 7 yuan per US dollar at the end of the year.Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Saturday that the pace of the yuan internationalization slowed in 2018, due to external factors and greater scrutiny imposed by regulators over cross-border capital flows.In the long term, the expansion of the use of the yuan will need to shift toward third-party use from the current situation in which the yuan is mostly used between China and its trading and investment partners. "Financial assets that are denominated in yuan and bilateral contracts to be settled in yuan are also drivers for the currency's global use," Xi said.The report said that to boost the yuan's internationalization, China needs to deepen reforms in the money, bond, stock and foreign exchange markets.Whether non-residents are willing to use and hold the yuan, and the scale at which they do so, will decide whether China could have a currency in line with its economic size and its status as the world's leading trading nation, the report said.Xiao Gang, former head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a forum over the weekend that the opening-up of the Chinese stock market should go hand in hand with foreign exchange and banking interests market reforms. According to a SWIFT report released on June 5, the rise of Chinese influence is strengthening yuan demand. For instance, Africa's adoption of the yuan appears to be increasing with the amount of yuan used in the first quarter of 2019 rising 53.48 percent from the first quarter of 2016.Newspaper headline: Wobbly road for yuan internationalization
