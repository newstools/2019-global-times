Illustrations: Peter C. Espina/GTChina's population is ageing and the elderly are grabbing attention. What old people care most about is remaining healthy. Spotting a weak prey, makers and distributors of health supplements have designed a marketing campaign meant to mislead with deceptive slogans and persuasive "lectures." Some dealers even say their products are a panacea for all ailments, especially graying hair. According to a report, the elderly account for over 50 percent of the healthcare market. Cases involving illegal health products emerge in an endless stream. Earlier this year, a fraud ring hawking health supplements was busted in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province. Cheap nutriments valued at 5 yuan ($0.73) were sold as a wonder drug to senior citizens at 5000 yuan. This isn't ordinary fleecing. Graying can convey experience and an ability to discern. Before going to grab the products, old people should think twice about the promised results. Instead of reliance on nutritional supplements, a healthy lifestyle and positive attitude are more helpful.
