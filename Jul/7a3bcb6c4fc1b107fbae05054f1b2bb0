"In a tragic road accident here today, a mini-bus skidded off hilly road and fell into gorge, killing 31 and injuring 15 others," Angrez Singh Rana, the deputy commissioner of Kishtwar, told Xinhua. According to Rana, of the injured, conditions of some were stated to be critical. Police said the victims were locals traveled on an intra-district mini-bus to reach the district headquarter. The death toll is likely to increase due to the critical conditions of some of the injured.
