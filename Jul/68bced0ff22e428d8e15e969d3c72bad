In particular, it is of great significance for the US and North Korea to agree to resume working-level consultations, which China supports," Geng said."China hopes the relevant countries seize the opportunity and work with each other to seek solutions and further push for progress in the denuclearization of Korean Peninsula." North Korea on Monday also hailed the weekend meeting as historic. The two leaders agreed to "resume and push forward productive dialogues for making a new breakthrough in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Monday."In 66 years since the Armistice Agreement in 1953 there happened such an amazing event of the top leaders of the DPRK (North Korea) and the US exchanging historic handshakes at Panmunjom, place that had been known as the symbol of division," the KCNA report said.KCNA said Kim and Trump discussed "issues of mutual concern and interest which become a stumbling block," and "voiced full understanding and sympathy."
