The UN peacekeeping chief said Wednesday that strong triangular cooperation -- namely between the UN Security Council, the troop/police-contributing countries (T/PCCs) and the UN Secretariat -- is crucial for enhancing peacekeeping operations.Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN undersecretary-general for peacekeeping operations, told the Security Council that the common work of the council, the T/PCCs and the secretariat, along with other stakeholders, will be key to ensuring continued progress.He said the benefits of the triangular cooperation apply to the safety and security of the peacekeepers, as well as to the performance of the operations.In addition, he encouraged delegates at the meeting to consider expanding the triangular cooperation "on occasion as required to ensure successful mandate implementation."He cited the existing Declaration of Shared Commitments on UN Peacekeeping Operations as an example, which includes commitments to enhancing collaboration and planning between the UN and international, regional, and sub-regional organizations and arrangements.The declaration also includes commitments to considering options for further direct engagement between host governments of peacekeeping operations and the Security Council, he added.Moreover, the undersecretary-general noted the African Union operations authorized by the Security Council have already seen "a form of quadrilateral cooperation -- between the Security Council, TCCs (troop contributing countries), the UN Secretariat and the African Union."Concluding his remarks, on behalf of the secretariat, Lacroix said, "We remain committed to working together with...both the Security Council members and the T/PCCs, to ensure mechanisms for triangular cooperation are robust and dynamic."
