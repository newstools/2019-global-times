"You would expect someone to come in and consolidate to benefit from economies of scale."VW is warning suppliers to prepare industry-wide solutions for winding down combustion-engine manufacturing as it ramps up mass production of EVs.The company is retooling 16 factories to build EVs and plans to start producing 33 different electric cars under the Skoda, Audi, VW and Seat brands by mid-2023, transforming the industry's supply chain."It makes no sense to have factories running at only 40 percent capacity," Stefan Sommer, VW's procurement head, told Reuters. "The auto industry is obliged to develop structures to consolidate combustion engine assets, to decide where to bundle certain activities.""If we end up with uncontrolled insolvencies, it will be a problem for the industry," he said.MismatchThere are more than 120 plants making combustion engine components in Europe, according to consulting firm AlixPartners.German auto industry association VDA said that 436,000 jobs are tied to building gasoline and diesel engines in Germany alone.Demand for compliant combustion engine assets has already triggered consolidation among carmakers themselves - PSA Group's takeover of General Motors' Opel business in 2017 was driven by that issue."With emissions regulations getting more stringent, particularly in Europe, some manufacturers are getting left behind in terms of their ability to develop compliant engines," said Franciscus van Meel, BMW's head of vehicle development.Until recently, deals have still proved difficult to do because of lingering disagreements over valuations. US group Dana late in 2018 launched the sale of its European head gasket business, a key component for combustion engines, people close to the matter said. With the help of Bank of America it invited suitors to bid, but pulled the auction several weeks later due to muted interest. The sale of Germany's closely held Ifa Group, a maker of shafts mainly used in combustion engine-powered cars, was announced a year ago, but never got over the finishing line. Among the few suitors was China's Wanxiang, but differences on pricing proved insurmountable, people close to the talks said."The main problem is that buyers' and sellers' price expectations don't match," KPMG partner Juergen Schlangenotto said."A seller typically says: I have a robust order book and good margins so I want a valuation of six times EBITDA [annual core earnings], while a buyer says there's no long-term growth so I am paying four times."A fresh test of interest in combustion engine assets will be the sale of engine parts and gear box parts maker Tekfor. Private equity owner KKR is in talks with a Chinese buyer, according to people close to the matter.James Kamsickas, CEO of US drivetrain supplier Dana, believes internal combustion engine demand could persist for many years."People are overbaking a little bit on how much the internal combustion engine is just going to go away."If anything, I'm a very strong advocate that it's going to be a world of hybridization for the next 15 years. Last time I checked, that still requires an internal combustion engine."
