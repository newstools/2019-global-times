In addition, Shanghai has accumulated $24.04 billion of foreign capital since the start of the reform and opening-up in 1978.Tesla became a recent addition to Shanghai's foreign manufacturing sector. Tesla's factory has now started to install production facilities, and production is expected to start at the end of the year with a capacity of about 3,000 vehicles per week, said Ma Chunlei, head of the Shanghai Development and Reform Commission.Apart from the manufacturing industry, Shanghai is also actively opening up its financial market. Shanghai is ranked No.5 among all the international financial centers according to the 25th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI 25), but with more opening-up plans, the city can climb up further the ranking.Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at Wuhan University, told the Global Times Tuesday that Shanghai can be one of the first cities to enjoy the fruits of the recent opening-up in the financial area."Shanghai has been enjoying the benefits of opening-up and international trade since 1978, and it has witnessed tremendous transformation," Dong said. "Now, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is making further plans to open up its financial area, which might in the future welcome foreign companies not just to do business in China, but also be listed in China, for example," he said.Shanghai's efforts have increased its GDP by 900-fold over the past 70 years, reaching the income level of upper-middle developed countries, and per capita GDP has jumped to more than $20,000, Ying said at the conference.
