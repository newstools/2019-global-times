It also represents an early urban civilization with complex functions and structures."Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City is a major archaeological discovery of China in the 20th century and an important cultural site that witnessed the 5,000-year civilization of the country," said Liu Yuzhu, head of China's National Cultural Heritage Administration, at the committee session."We are proud that after 25 years of preparation, our efforts have finally led to the successful inscription of this exceptionally important property, which is the most concrete testimony of 5,000 years of Chinese civilization," said Shen Yang, ambassador and permanent delegate of China to the UNESCO, following the announcement of the decision."We are keenly aware that the inscription also entails an enormous responsibility for conserving this heritage of humanity," he added.Zhou Jiangyong, Hangzhou's municipal committee secretary of the Communist Party of China, said the Chinese city will spare no effort to "protect and make proper use of the enormous cultural heritage before passing it on to the the future generations."The Chinese side also pledged continued efforts and strengthened international cooperation in the protection and management of the world heritages in China.The 43rd convention of the World Heritage Committee, held from June 30 to July 10, started on Friday to examine world heritage nominations. According to its agenda, it will also review the state of conservation of 166 sites on the World Heritage List, 54 of which are also on the List of World Heritage in Danger.On Friday, China's Migratory Bird Sanctuaries along the Coast of the Yellow Sea-Bohai Gulf (Phase I) was inscribed to the World Heritage List as a natural site.At present, China has 55 world heritage sites, including 37 cultural sites, 14 natural sites, and 4 cultural and natural heritages.
