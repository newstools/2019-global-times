They used less glass to minimize heat and incorporated balconies to catch the sea breezes.Another stop was at nearby Dizengoff Square, a city landmark dominated by prominent Bauhaus buildings, including the immaculate white Hotel Cinema.Gross says that while the number of visitors to the Bauhaus Centre has tripled in recent years, the White City is more of an impulse destination than Jerusalem and its holy sites. Architect Sharon Golan Yaron is content manager of the White City Centre, set up in 2015 by the Tel Aviv city council and the German government to "preserve the heritage of the White City." She says that while the Bauhaus influence is notable, other architectural styles have shaped Tel Aviv.Iconic Swiss-born modernist Le Corbusier in particular left his mark, she says, adding that rather than using Bauhaus as a blanket term it would be more accurate to describe Tel Aviv's architectural heritage as "international."  The international style emphasizes space as opposed to mass. It spread throughout the world until the 1980s. Unlike some other heritage buildings, says Golan Yaron, those of the White City are still lived in.She adds that their architects worked by the socialist-Zionist ideals of their time which saw the building of the new city as part of the creation of a new society, culminating in 1948 with the establishment of the state of Israel."It is the physical expression of Zionism," she says.
