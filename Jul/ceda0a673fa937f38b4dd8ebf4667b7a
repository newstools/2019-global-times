There are so many photographers following closely, but they pretend to be surprised and shy when the camera looks at them, a net user complained on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo.Street snap, or street photography, which was originally invented to highlight popular elements in normal daily life, is apparently being redefined in China by the new snap gif trend.There are no beautiful clothes, only overexerted performances, netizens said.The trend was started by popular short-video streaming platforms, such as TikTok and Kuaishou, which makes it easier for those who want to make a name for themselves and, of course, fortunes.Behind the celebrities and models, there are photography teams, incubator companies and, at last, products suppliers, insiders told the media.When these pictures, short videos and gifs are uploaded to the internet, advertisements for the models' clothes, bags and shoes will be attached.By this measure, Zhou Xiang, a garment company owner in Hangzhou, told the media that he once sold about 600,000 items of clothing in a single day.The companies usually divide the incomes equally with the celebrities, according to Zhou.Photographers also benefit from the business. They can reportedly gain as much as 30,000 ($4,360) yuan a day to take photos of celebrities.
