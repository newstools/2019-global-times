The cooperation between China and Venezuela and the cooperation between China and Latin America adhere to the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefits, and benefit both peoples, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday.Geng Shuang made the comments at a press conference in response to report that Craig Faller, head of the United States Southern Command, said China was the largest creditor country of Venezuela and made Venezuelan people carry a debt burden.Geng said US officials repeatedly attacked China's cooperation with Venezuela and Latin America recently, but their arguments were full of loopholes and could not stand up to scrutiny.He said that the cooperation between China and Venezuela and the cooperation between China and Latin America adhere to the principles of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, and focus on common development, which have brought tangible benefits to the people of both sides and promoted local economic and social development and are widely welcomed by the people of Venezuela and Latin America.If the United States really cares about the development of Latin America, it should take practical measures to help boost local economy and improve people's livelihoods, Geng said."China-Latin America relations is equal, mutually beneficial, innovative, open, benefiting the people, and not exclusive," Geng said. "We hold a positive attitude towards cooperation with all sides including the United States in Latin America, and hope the US side also has the same attitude."
