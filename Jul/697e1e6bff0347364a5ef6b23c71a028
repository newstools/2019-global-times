China has not seen a large-scale exit in its manufacturing sector and is confident in attracting more foreign firms seeking long-term development, the top economic planner said Tuesday."Most of those pulling out are mid- to low-end firms and the impact on China's economic growth, industry upgrading and employment is generally controllable," Meng Wei, a spokesperson of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a news conference when answering a question on reported withdrawals.Citing in-depth changes to the global industrial landscape and the upgrading of China's manufacturing industry, Meng said it was a normal phenomenon for some enterprises to set up factories abroad.Some firms moved out to lower costs or as part of their development strategy in international market expansion, while a very small number of firms shifted out to avoid the impact of the Sino-US trade frictions, Meng said."To be clear, it is not easy for companies to relocate, and there are a number of factors to consider, including operating costs, industrial workers, supply chain support, transportation and even manufacturing culture," she said.The NDRC will continue working with other authorities to deepen market-oriented reforms, expand high-level opening-up, and build a world-class business environment to further enhance the country's appeal to the manufacturing industry, Meng said."We believe that with a series of policies and measures starting to take effect, the overwhelming majority of enterprises will stay in China for long-term development, and more enterprises will come to invest in China," she said.
