The Communist Party of China (CPC) is a very dynamic organization and by far the most successful political organization in the world, according to a prominent China expert from Britain. Martin Jacques, a senior fellow at Cambridge University, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua on the sidelines of the second Wanshou Dialogue on Global Security, which lasts from Monday to Wednesday. Jacques said the CPC has been very successful at reinventing itself to move with the times, which is quite difficult for big parties like the CPC. Monday marked the 98th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, which had 90.59 million members with 4.61 million primary-level Party organizations as of the end of 2018. The CPC has proved remarkably gifted at providing leadership for the country and shown itself to be capable of learning from its own mistakes, said Jacques, adding that it needs a very self-confident and deeply rooted organization to be able to make major policy adjustments as China has done. For example, the CPC has launched an education campaign themed "staying true to our founding mission" in May among all Party members nationwide. He stressed that the political leadership of the CPC is one of the key reasons for China's success over the past 70 years, such as economic development, poverty reduction and improving people's living standard. Noting that governance in China is very different from how politics works in the west, he said the cold war mentality is still shaping western thinking, but people in the west are starting to see a more positive side to China. There are lots of things that need to be improved in China, but the transformation of China is one of the greatest achievements in human history, and the CPC leadership is a key to that success, according to Jacques.
