That was nearly 40 percent of the estimated total population of 41,700."People leaving Rukban receive basic assistance at temporary collective shelters in Homs, before proceeding to their areas of choice, mostly towards southern and eastern Homs," Haq said.The United Nations has been granted access to the Homs shelters on three occasions and found conditions there to be adequate during the visits, the spokesman said."The UN is currently awaiting approval from the government of Syria on an operational plan submitted last week to assess needs inside Rukban, to assist with transport for people who wish to leave, and to provide humanitarian relief for those who decide to remain," Haq said.The United Nations continues to call for safe, sustained and unimpeded humanitarian access to Rukban, as well as to all those in need throughout Syria, he added.
