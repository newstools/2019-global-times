A leading cybersecurity official of China is urging the fast rolling-out and promulgation of China's data security law on Tuesday."We will push for the speedy rolling-out of the data security law," said Hu Xiao, deputy director-general of the Cyberspace Administration of China's (CAC) Cybersecurity Coordination Bureau.Hu said the faster rolling-out of these legal frameworks, including the law and related data security management regulations, will ensure speedier efforts by the central government to protect personal information and ensure the security of vital data. The establishment of an assessment regime for personal information and vital data is also needed, according to Hu, who delivered a speech at the 2019 Cyber Security Summit that kicked off on Tuesday. The data security law, along with the personal data protection law, is on the legislators' agenda in 2019.Chinese legislators have attached great importance to data security, and the country passed the National Security Law in 2015, and the Cybersecurity Law in 2016.They also see there is a necessity to formulate laws and regulations specifically on data security at the national level, to better safeguard national security in an increasingly digitalized society.Earlier this month, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began a one-year campaign on data security protection, targeting security risks including data leakage and data abuse.In his speech, Hu also urged the protection of the nation's vital information technology infrastructure.
