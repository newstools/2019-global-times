Mohammed, rector of the African Institute of International Law, told the Global Times on the sidelines of the colloquium that countries like the US, which has been withdrawing from UN organizations and treaties, threaten the international legal order and do not respect international rules. Mohammed praised China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Africa's immense infrastructure needs justify the continent's integration into the BRI, he said, and many African countries have developed their legal systems to better accommodate the initiative.Developing countries should condemn unilateral sanctions by "certain countries" that illegally deprive targeted nations of basic human needs, said Rahmat Mohamad, deputy vice-chancellor at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) in Malaysia and former secretary-general of the Asia-Africa Legal Consultative Organization.
