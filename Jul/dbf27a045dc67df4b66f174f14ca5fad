Otherwise, the economy could be worse," Liang told the Global Times on Wednesday. Liang referred to rising speculation that China could resort to a broad stimulus that would increase debt.China is also likely to increase fiscal spending in the second half to stabilize growth, Liu Dongliang, an economist at the China Merchants Bank, wrote in a research note. Proactive fiscal policy could unleash as much as 350 billion yuan ($50.9 billion) in the second half of the year and special government bonds could raise 800 billion yuan for investment in infrastructure, the note said. Chinese officials maintained they are not resorting to a "flood irrigation" stimulus, a reference to those more aggressive and wasteful pro-growth policies of the past. "We are resolute about not engaging in 'flood irrigation' and will be effective in fending off hidden risks in local government debt," Meng Wei, a spokesperson for the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a press briefing on Tuesday.Analysts said that even without raising debt to risky levels, the combination of measures are sufficient to keep growth stable in the second half and reach 6 percent or higher for the full year, despite the challenges, including the trade war with the US.As global headlines focused on the trade war with the US, Chinese officials and analysts also stressed that the biggest challenge for China is pushing forward with market reforms to generate high-quality growth. "The trade war has some impact but China's economy is not as reliant on trade as before," said Liu Ying, a research fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China. "Now the biggest growth driver is domestic consumption and so our focus should be how to boost consumption."
