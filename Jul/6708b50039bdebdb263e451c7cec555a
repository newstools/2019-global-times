The US slapping more tariffs on Chinese imports would add hurdles to the bilateral trade consultations, extending the time slot needed for a trade settlement, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday, commenting on US President Donald Trump's latest statement regarding tariffs on Chinese imports.President Trump threatened that he could impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports if he wants, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. Trump promised to hold off on more duties in a trade-war truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting in Osaka at the end of June. "We have a long way to go with tariffs where China is concerned, if we want. We have another $325 billion we can put a tariff on, if we want," Trump said. "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step," FM Spokesman Geng Shuang used a Chinese idiom to refer to the "long way" mentioned by the US President. China hopes the US should show determination and perseverance, and that they could resolve the differences between the two countries via consultations on the basis of mutual respect and equality. "Additional tariffs will put barriers on the trade consultations and will prolong the time needed to reach a deal," Geng said.
