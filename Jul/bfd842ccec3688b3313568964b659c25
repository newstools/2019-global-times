Promotional material for Swan Lake Photo: Courtesy of the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center Swan Lake by Matthew Bourne is returning to China, the show's organizers announced. It will be performed in Shanghai in August and Beijing in September.The British director and choreographer's interpretation of the Tchaikovsky love story features an all-male ensemble. Considered his signature work, it made its debut in London in 1995. It has since then been performed in Europe and countries such as the US, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Israel.  While this will be the first time the show has been performed in Beijing, the dance performance was previously performed in Shanghai in 2014. "I am very happy that everyone can see this new version, because we have many new faces among the dancers and new scenery designs, lighting and upgrades [in other aspects]," said Bourne at the announcement."More than 20 years ago, due to technical barriers, it was hard to realize the innovations [we have today]. In the new version, we employ projecting technology. The audiences will see the swans flying on the stage," he added. The new version will be performed at the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center in Beijing September 5-8. Tickets are available for purchase online and at local theaters.
