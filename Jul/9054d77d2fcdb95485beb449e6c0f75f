Cypriot Parliament President Demetris Syllouris Thursday lauded the "comprehensive and strategic partnership" between Cyprus and China at a special event themed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Nicosia. Speaking at a colloquium on the role of globalization in the era of the BRI held at the European University Cyprus, Syllouris said that "from the very beginning, Cyprus supported the Belt and Road Initiative. We strongly advocate that this project will be in Europe's best interest." Syllouris said that he strongly believes that Cyprus's location at the crossroads of three continents provides an important "geo-strategic advantage." The BRI "constitutes a project that strives to build bridges between countries, nations and citizens," he said. "Not only political, economical and financial, but also bridges in synergies of our diverse and rich history, heritage, knowledge and culture." Huang Xingyuan, Chinese ambassador to Cyprus, said the international landscape is going through profound changes and the world economy is facing many challenges. "Cyprus may be a small country in terms of size," he said, "but it's located at the crossroads of Asia, Europe and Africa." Cyprus can be a pivot to the BRI, and also an engine for regional peace and stability, Huang added.
