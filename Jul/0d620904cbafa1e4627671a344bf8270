We will honor this mandate in full. From now on the hard work starts. I have absolute confidence in our ability to be a match for what is at stake," Mitsotakis told media after the ceremony.The newly sworn-in prime minister headed to the Maximos Mansion, where the seat of government has been based for the past few decades, for the handover ceremony.Former prime minister Alexis Tsipras welcomed him and gave over the office to the newly elected.
