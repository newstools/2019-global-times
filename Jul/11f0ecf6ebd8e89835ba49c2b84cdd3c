US President Donald Trump attends a bilateral meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan on Friday. The US Senate has passed a legislative provision to increase defense cooperation with India that puts the country on a par with America's NATO allies and countries like Israel and South Korea, the Indian newspaper The Hindu reported Tuesday.The National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA for the fiscal year 2020, which contains the provision, was passed by the US Senate last week, according to the report.The amendment provides for increased US-India defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean in the areas of humanitarian assistance, counterterrorism, counter-piracy and maritime security, the newspaper said."The US is trying to draw India to its side to balance out China," said Sun Shihai, an expert at the South Asia Research Center under Sichuan University. "But India is unlikely to be dependent on the US as it is seeking an independent role among the world's major powers."Last week, the US Congress' India Caucus Co-Chair Brad Sherman, along with Congressmen Joe Wilson, Ami Bera, Ted Yoho, George Holding, Ed Case and Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced a similar legislative proposal that would greatly enhance the US-India relationship.That proposal is expected to come before congress sometime in July, before legislators adjourn for the month-long August recess on July 29.In a statement, the Hindu American Foundation commended two senators for their efforts in advancing the US-India strategic partnership.Experts view the US move a symbolic one that indicates its growing confidence in India, the Financial Express reported Wednesday.  Fu Xiaoqiang, an expert on South Asian studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the US move will benefit India in purchasing US high-end military equipment.But Fu noted that for now, India is unlikely to increase its purchase of US equipment as Modi will seek a balance between Russia and the US.India has long had military cooperation with Russia, and is a big buyer of Russian arms.The latest arms deal between the two countries was the $5 billion S-400 air defense system deal in October 2018, after wide-ranging talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin."Though India is considered an ally to the US it won't tolerate being thought of as a puppet of the US," Fu said. "It will seek the benefit of the status while keeping a distance from Washington."The US and India are also experiencing trade frictions, with a new round of bilateral talks scheduled next week, analysts believed.
