The Inorganic Mysteries Photo: Xu Liuliu/GTA new exhibition, Lying Sophia & Mocking Alexa, at the Hyundai Motorstudio Beijing in the 798 Art District has captured visitors' attention with exhibits inspired by the latest AI (artificial intelligence) technology. According to curator Iris Long, the exhibition doesn't aim to make a conclusion as to whether AI will help or destroy human beings, but rather explores the relationship between humans and machines as well as how AI can be used as a computational model in art curation. First turned on in 2015, the AI robot Sophia has been called "the most beautiful and celebrated robot" by its creators Hanson Robotics, while Amazon's Alexa, created in 2010, went viral after letting out a peel of eerie laughter in 2018. Long said that Sophia and Alexa are two contemporary metaphors on machine life. Sophia symbolizes the portrayal of AI by mass media, films and televisions… while Alexa is an "assistant" or "servant" who takes a machine outlook and resides in domestic corners. Highlights at the exhibition include Tear Set, CACA Investment and two talking AIs in Alice & Bob.  The exhibition is set to run until October 21.
