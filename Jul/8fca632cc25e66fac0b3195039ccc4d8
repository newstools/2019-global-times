Australia's Minister for Industry has said 3D printing, food processing and nanosatellites could be the future focus of Australian manufacturing. Karen Andrews, the minister for industry, science and technology, on Wednesday convened a meeting of business groups, the nation's largest manufacturers and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to discuss the future of the industry. Speaking to Fairfax Media prior to the meeting, she said that she wants advice from the experts on where the sector should be in 10 years. "Australia will always be a manufacturing nation. What we need to do is look at the future of manufacturing in Australia. Where are our strengths and where are our opportunities?" she said. "We can't continue to try and be all things to all people." She said that she was going into the meeting with an open mind but has previously been advised that space was an emerging area in the form of nanosatellites. The manufacturing sector in Australia currently employs about 850,000 people. In order to deliver on his promise to create 1.25 million new jobs over the next five years, Prime Minister Scott Morrison will have to oversee a significant manufacturing boost. Andrews said that the 3D printing and food processing are key to the growth, identifying export opportunities in Southeast Asia. "We've long talked about the need to value add to our resources," she said. "We've talked about this for the best part of 30 years. So we need to start doing that value add. We do it in food, let's maximise that."
