According to the MOFOCM, "middle products" accounted for 78 percent of China's imported goods in terms of value in 2018, and 47.5 percent of Chinese exports are "middle products." The criteria for listing include foreign entities that block and shut supply chains, take discriminatory measures for non-commercial reasons, and cause actual or potential damage to Chinese companies and industries. Endangering or potentially endangering China's national security is also listed as a criterion. Once such companies are listed, they will face necessary legal and administrative measures and the Chinese public can also be warned against dealing with them to reduce risks. The legal basis of the list is solidly supported by Chinese laws, according to the MOFCOM.The list is undergoing a legal process and will be rolled out in the near future, according to MOFCOM.
