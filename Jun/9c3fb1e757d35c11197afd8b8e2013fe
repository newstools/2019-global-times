The vehicle can resist concentrated attacks from 7.62 millimeter caliber rounds, a bullet type used by many rifles, proving it can protect personnel within from light weapon fire, the report said.While the report did not identify the name of the vehicle, Chinese military observers said on Thursday judging by its logos the vehicle is likely the latest product from the Dongfeng Mengshi off-road vehicle series.Compared to previous in-service vehicles, the new vehicle likely features technology allowing it to operate during more complicated battlefield situations and will have a longer service life, an expert on military vehicles told the Global Times on Thursday, requesting anonymity.The new Chinese vehicle can be compared with the US' Humvee, but is probably even superior to it in terms of armor and versatility, the expert said.Two versions of the vehicle were spotted in the CCTV report, one with four wheels, and another with six wheels towing a cart.The vehicle can not only conduct personnel transportation missions, but also can be modified to become a battlefield ambulance, a command vehicle or a platform of heavy weapons, CCTV reported.The heavy weapons could include heavy machine guns, rockets launchers and missiles, making the weapons highly mobile even over extreme terrain, the anonymous expert predicted.
