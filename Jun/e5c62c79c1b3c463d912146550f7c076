An apparel factory located in Batticaloa, in eastern Sri Lanka, has become the world's first manufacturing facility to achieve "Net Zero Carbon" status, a local media report said here Thursday. One of Sri Lanka's leading apparel factories, Brandix, said in a statement that its facility in Batticaloa had achieved this status after the company had completely neutralized its environmental impact through carbon dioxide emissions by being highly energy efficient and using onsite renewable energy resources. Recognized by the World Green Building Council (WGBC), the "Net Zero Carbon" certification is issued by the Leonardo Academy and comes in the background of countries around the world examining ways in which to minimize their contribution towards drastic climate change. Brandix Group CEO, Ashroff Omar said that in 2007, when Brandix began its journey in sustainability, they had envisioned it becoming the most sustainable apparel manufacturer in Asia. "Soon after, we went on to achieve a global milestone in 2008 by securing the world's first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification for our factory in Seeduwa, setting the trend for other manufacturers to follow in our wake," Ashroff said. "It is truly a monumental milestone for us, therefore, to secure another world first, by achieving Net Zero Carbon status for our factory in Batticaloa, as the first Sri Lankan company and apparel manufacturer to join in on the World Green Building Council commitment," Ashroff added.
