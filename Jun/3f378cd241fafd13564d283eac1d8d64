Donald Trump's threat to begin deporting "millions of illegal aliens" next week triggered heated rhetoric Tuesday on both sides of the country's political divide, with Democrats warning the US president was fear-mongering ahead of his ­re-election campaign launch.Liberal lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went so far as to accuse the Trump administration of operating "concentration camps" at the border, where a surge of migrants has all but overwhelmed US officials' capacity to detain them.Trump vowed to have US Immigration and Customs ­Enforcement arrest and remove undocumented migrants "as fast as they come in" - a move that could disrupt thousands of families.
