Therefore, they need a higher professional ethical standard. Our government and educational institutions should pay more attention to teacher's professional ethics," Ren said, noting the problem is also about the future of our nation. Although most teachers are respected and disciplined, the misconduct of a few always brings shame to the whole group and society, analysts said.
