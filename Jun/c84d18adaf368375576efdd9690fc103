Illustration: Peter C.Espina/GTThe popularity of soccer among Chinese kids is driving some parents to score an own goal. Chinese parents yearn for foreigners to train their children in the nuances of the beautiful game. Even though academies employing foreign trainers charge double the money than those having Chinese coaches, parents are more than willing to pay. They believe as professional Chinese footballers do not perform well, Chinese coaches must be inferior to their foreign counterparts. This has led to unqualified foreign coaches taking advantage of the situation. Xinhua reported about an American who sells noodles in Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality working as a soccer coach. Unscrupulous soccer academies prey on the yearning for a foreign face and employ unqualified expats. Such unskilled coaches do a shoddy job and fail to effectively train children. Authorities need to off-side such racketeers and blow the final whistle on such a "game."
