It has also tapped its planning expertise by working with African countries on planning consultations that have led to five reports so far."The CDB is as big as the World Bank," Baba Ahmad Jidda, ambassador of Nigeria to China, told the Global Times on Monday. "We believe our relationship with China is going to improve every day."The ambassador of Africa's largest economy emphasized the importance of China's concessional loans, which have lower interest rates and longer maturity time, and offer African countries more affordable financing for their major projects.In 2018, China's trade with Africa reached $204.2 billion, up 20 percent year-on-year, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed. China remained Africa's largest trading partner for the 10th consecutive year.Hu Changmiao, board secretary of state-owned China Construction Bank (CCB), told the seminar that a number of cutting-edge financial technologies can be deployed to boost risk management capacity and therefore aid China-Africa cooperation.Blockchain, big data and artificial intelligence can help foster risk management, Hu said.CCB has shown its ambition in the field by becoming the first major state-owned bank to set up a wholly owned subsidiary dealing with financial technology in April 2018 with a 3,000-strong team.The CCB platform, empowered by cutting-edge technologies, could help creditors improve their risk management when dealing with loans to Chinese companies doing businesses in Africa or doing Africa-related business including exports, the Global Times learned.Newspaper headline: Financing China-Africa projects
