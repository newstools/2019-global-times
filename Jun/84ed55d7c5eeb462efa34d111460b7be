Chairman of Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC) Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan has called on the Sudanese opposition to initiate dialogue for national interest and to overcome the current crisis. Al-Burhan made the call in a televised statement Wednesday on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr. "We extend our hands for a dialogue that only observes the interest of the homeland," said Al-Burhan in the statement. However, the major opposition forces rejected the call for dialogue and demanded the resignation of the TMC chairman in the wake of dispersing the sit-in in front of the army's headquarters last Monday.
