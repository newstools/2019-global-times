"The times and trends are all in favor of the forces supporting the reunification and national rejuvenation," he said.CLOSER ECONOMIC TIESCross-Straits economic complementarity is strong, and mutually beneficial cooperation between the mainland and Taiwan has advantaged conditions, Wang said, noting that the mainland economy is moving toward a stage of high-quality development and high-level opening up, and its demand for high-quality products and services of various kinds is increasing day by day.He stressed that economic exchanges and integration across the Taiwan Straits not only is the right thing to do but also yields great benefits."There is no reason for the exchanges and integration between both sides not to get closer and better," Wang said, "And it will surely get closer and better."STICKING TO 1992 CONSENSUSPeaceful reunification will cost both sides of the Straits the least and bring compatriots the greatest benefits, he said.On the basis of adhering to the 1992 Consensus and opposing "Taiwan independence," the mainland is willing to engage in extensive and in-depth dialogue and consultation with parties, organizations and individuals from Taiwan to resolve differences, seek common ground and move toward the goal of peaceful reunification step by step, Wang said."We are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will definitely not leave any leeway to 'Taiwan independence' separatist activities at all," he stressed.He called on compatriots on both sides of the Straits to join hands in firmly rejecting "Taiwan independence" and safeguarding the homeland.Adhering to the 1992 Consensus and opposing "Taiwan independence" is the "ballast stone" of the Cross-Straits ties, and compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits should take an active part in Cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation and contribute to maintaining stability across the Straits, promoting integrated development, and enhancing the compatriots' well-being, according to Tseng Yung-chuan, vice chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang party, and other speakers at the event.PURSUE DREAM ON MAINLANDDuring Wang's stay in Fujian for the forum, he visited Minjiang University, Genius Electronic Optical (Xiamen) Co., Ltd. and other places and held a symposium with representatives of young people from Taiwan who are working or studying on the mainland.Wang encouraged the young people from Taiwan to use their personal experience to tell more Taiwan compatriots stories about studying and starting businesses on the mainland, about the development and changes on the mainland, and to enhance mutual understanding among people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.Wang urged authorities concerned to push for the sound implementation of policies and measures introduced to benefit Taiwan and people from the island, solve difficulties encountered by young people from Taiwan in their schooling, employment, and entrepreneurship on the mainland, and help more young people from Taiwan pursue, build and realize their dreams on the mainland.Prior to the opening of the forum, Wang met with some of the delegates to the forum from both sides of the Straits and representatives of the event's sponsoring organizations.
