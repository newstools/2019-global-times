The statement on further deepening the China-Kyrgyzstan comprehensive strategic partnership was released as Chinese President Xi Jinping is paying a state visit to the Central Asian country, where he will also attend the 19th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.

They also agreed to keep communicating with each other on pushing forward the project of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway.
