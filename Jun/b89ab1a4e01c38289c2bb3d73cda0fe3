DJI, the global leader in civilian drones and aerial imaging technology was surprised to see their newly-launched educational robot has gained more popularity in the market than it expected.  "This product requires a certain technical background, and we thought it would be a niche product and needed to be promoted slowly. But we found that the first batch of the product was sold out even before the press conference had finished, which was unexpected," Titans Xie, spokesperson from DJI told the Global Times on Monday.The Global Times found that there are consumers worrying about the possibility of the product being remodeled on military purposes, he said "in fact, we have fully considered this, and we have technical restrictions on product modifications and we added many safety measures."   His comments came after the company launched the RoboMaster S1, its first ground-based robot, on Wednesday, as a latest step in educational technology.The S1 was built to introduce new users to the fun and possibilities of robotic technology, with powerful brushless motors, a chassis that can move in all directions, a high-precision gimbal, and interactive modes for programming, play, and competition. Users can have fun while assembling designated and custom made hardware, learning to maneuver the rover, programming with Python or Scratch and competing with friends in multiplayer battle modes. "We developed the RoboMaster S1 with the next generation of innovators in mind, making robotics and programming not just more accessible but also an entertaining and academic experience," Frank Wang, DJI's founder & CEO said in a note sent to the Global Times.The S1 is equipped with 31 sensors to help map the world around it, including six on its intelligent body armor, which are used to detect hits. Atop the S1's frame is a first-person view camera that sends a stabilized live feed from the S1 to the RoboMaster app.It also features specialized multiplayer battle modes, and the mode even can include four mystery bonuses that players can use against their opponents: Dizziness, Electromagnetic Interference, Extreme Speed, and Invincibility.  The RoboMaster S1 was available for purchase for the retail price of $499 on Wednesday, but the price has gone up to $800 on taobao.com, the largest online shopping platform.
