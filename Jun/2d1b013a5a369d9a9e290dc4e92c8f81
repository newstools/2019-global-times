US drug imports in the year hit $72.8 billion, according to media reports.It is undeniable that key ingredients for many essential drugs from antibiotics and birth control pills to treatments for cancer, depression, high cholesterol and HIV/AIDS are purchased from China, but that doesn't justify jumping to the conclusion that China is controlling the US market, said Li Tianquan, co-founder of domestic healthcare big data platform yaozh.com.Li told the Global Times on Monday that China is a big pharmaceutical producing country but not a strong one at the moment.Â "We've stepped up medical research and innovation in recent years, but still lag behind the standards of US or European countries, so there is a long way to go," said Li.A list of products subject to possible US tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese imports will include cellphones and laptop computers but not pharmaceuticals and rare-earth elements, Reuters reported in May, citing the US Trade Representative's Office.The list excluded Chinese-made pharmaceuticals, inputs for pharmaceuticals and select medical products."Tariff hikes will mean price increase for low-costs APIs that are mainly used for ordinary drugs, thus having an impact on US drug makers and consumers. This will increase the US national health care burden," said Li
