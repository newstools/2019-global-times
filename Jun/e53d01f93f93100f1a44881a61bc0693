At least 16 people died in heavy intensity dust-storm and rains, coupled with lightening, that hit some parts of India's northern state Uttar Pradesh on Thursday evening, local media reports said Friday. While six persons died in Mainpuri district, three died in Kasganj and Eta districts, each, and one person died in Agra, Rampur, Badaun and Pilibhit districts, each. Some of them died in incidents of lightening, while others died from falling trees or walls, said media reports. Local administrations in each of these districts have announced a compensation of 400,000 Indian Rupees (5700 US dollars) for each of the families whose members died in the inclement weather, reported the Hindi daily "Hindustan". Besides, a large number of cattle also reportedly died in the storm. Efforts are being made to assess the quantum of loss of lives and property in all the affected areas.
