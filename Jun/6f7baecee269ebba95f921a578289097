The Chinese education authority on Thursday stressed taking precautions to ensure students' safety as the rainy season swings into gear in the country. Local educational administrations and schools nationwide should launch safety checks on school buildings and facilities and reduce or ban outdoor activities by students in harsh or extreme weather conditions, according to a statement issued by the office of the State Council education supervision committee. Efforts should be made to strengthen the training of school bus drivers in order to raise their awareness of traffic safety and improve their ability to deal with emergencies, said the statement. Schools should also increase safety education among students to prevent them from drowning or being struck by lightning during severe thunderstorms, it said.
