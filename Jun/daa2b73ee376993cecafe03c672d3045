(The Confucius center) can serve as a traditional Chinese cultural research and learning center for global Chinese people," Yang Chaoming, head of the Confucius Research Institute of China and member of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who proposed the plan, told the Global Times on Monday."If Chinese culture is compared to a big tree, Confucianism is the trunk. To understand how our traditional culture has developed, we must know the roots of the tree," Yang said.Under the influence of Confucian doctrine, the Chinese people have lived together peacefully for thousands of years. Confucian thoughts have nurtured generations of outstanding descendants, he said. In September 2018, Liu, the Party Chief, said at the international Confucius cultural festival in Qufu, Confucius' hometown, that Shandong is implementing the "Confucianism Masters" program, which will promote the establishment of Confucius University and a Confucian research center.The MOE also announced on its website in January that the center should be included in the plans of colleges and universities in Shandong."We encourage educational institutions [in Shandong] to strengthen research on traditional culture, train traditional culture talent and promote the integrated and innovative development of excellent traditional Chinese culture," the announcement said.
