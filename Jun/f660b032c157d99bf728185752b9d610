Lebanese Tourism Minister Avedis Guidanian said Thursday that Tripoli's terrorist attacks will not have a big impact on tourism in Lebanon this summer, local media reported. "Of course there will be a little bit of impact but not much," Guidanian was quoted as saying by Elnashra, an online independent newspaper. Guidanian assured that he met with tourists from Gulf countries at the airport a few days ago and they did not voice any concerns about security situation in Lebanon. A terrorist attack hit Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli on Tuesday early morning when an Islamic State (IS) member blew himself up after being pursued and cornered by the police and Internal Security Forces. Lebanese officials voiced their concerns about the impact of such attacks on Lebanon's tourism, a pillar of the country's economy. The minister said that reservations in Lebanon's hotels have gone up tremendously during Eid al-Fitr, expected to drop in the coming days and then increase again during summer in July and August. Lebanon is hoping to attract more tourists from Saudi Arabia after the kingdom removed a travel warning against Lebanon earlier this year.
