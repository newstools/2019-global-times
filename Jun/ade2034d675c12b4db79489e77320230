Fourteen passengers were injured after a driverless five-car train in suburban Tokyo went in the wrong direction and crashed into a buffer stop, ­Japanese police said Sunday.Local media reported that some injuries - the first resulting from an accident involving an automated train in 30 years - appeared to be serious but non-life-threatening.The train hit the buffer stop at Shin-Sugita station after traveling the wrong way for about 20 meters, Akihiko Mikami, president of the train operator, said in a midnight press conference.The station is a terminal of the self-driving Kanazawa Seaside Line in the port city of ­Yokohama.Mikami added that the operator has shut down the line and it was uncertain when services would be resumed.Compared to self-driving cars that have recently taken the road in several countries on a test basis, automated trains have a relatively long history in Japan.Among accidents that have made headlines are a collision involving an autonomous Uber vehicle that killed a pedestrian and a fatal crash that involved electric carmaker Tesla's "Autopilot" feature, both of which ­occurred last year in the US.
