Police in north China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region have detained one suspect and seized more than 7 kg of drugs at a village store, local authorities said Sunday.
In mid-May, police in the city of Baotou found a truck driver suspected of taking caffeine sodium benzoate pills who said he bought the drug from a convenience store in Changhan village.
On May 21, police detained the shop owner surnamed Chen and seized 20 ecstasy pills and more than 7.15 kg of caffeine sodium benzoate pills.
According to Chen, a pill of caffeine sodium benzoate was sold for about 35 yuan (5.07 U.S. dollars), with a profit of 50 percent. Most buyers were truck drivers.
Further investigation is underway.
Caffeine sodium benzoate is a psychoactive substance under strict regulation in China and has been listed as drug in the country. It was once used as a kind of veterinary medicine and can bring excitement to people who take it.
