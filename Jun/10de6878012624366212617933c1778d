"Issuing the license means everything is almost ready."MIIT also sent out a signal that China is not scared of the US-led crackdown on Huawei, which is also a major driving force in global 5G development, and the country will continue competing to lead the 5G race at a firm pace, analysts said. "As the US treats China as a competitor, it is only normal that [China] also speeds up a bit accordingly," Jiang Junmu, chief reporter at telecom industry news website c114.com.cn, told the Global Times on Monday. Chinese companies' advanced technologies and massive user base make the potential of China's commercial 5G enormous, he said. Though Huawei is likely to dominate the 5G equipment market in China, "China will also include other companies in the rollout of 5G, unlike the US," Fu said, noting that Huawei, ZTE, Ericson and Nokia will all have the same treatment and opportunity in China.Foreign companies, including Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel, have been involved in 5G roll-out in China, and the country continues to welcome domestic and foreign firms to participate in the network build-out, MIIT said.
