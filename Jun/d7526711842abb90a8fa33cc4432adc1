China and France should well implement the consensus reached between their leaders, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said over a phone conversation on Monday with Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic counselor to French President Emmanuel Macron. He said the two countries should respect and give consideration to each other's core and just concerns to uplift bilateral pragmatic cooperation to a new level and further enhance the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership under the new circumstances. Currently, unilateralism, protectionism and bullying behaviors are impacting the world economic order severely and imposing negative influences over global governance as well as world peace and stability, Wang said. China and France, as independent and influential major countries in the world, should strengthen strategic coordinations and join hands to play due roles in maintaining world peace and order, he said. At the upcoming Group of 20 (G20) summit scheduled for June in Osaka, Japan, China and France should push for a concerted and positive call for safeguarding multilateralism, opposing unilateralism and protectionism, maintaining the multilateral trade system with the World Trade Organization at the core, carrying forward the spirit of partnership, and promoting the balanced and inclusive development of the world economy, he said. The Chinese foreign minister noted that China is willing to work together with France to continuously push for the implementation of the Paris climate change agreement and promote the green, low-carbon and sustainable development of the world. Bonne said that Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to France in March this year was very successful and France would keep close high-level exchanges with China, fully respect each other's interests and concerns, continue to enhance mutual trust and deepen pragmatic cooperation. Both France and China are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and both countries highly value and always adhere to multilateralism and international cooperation, Bonne said. The tow sides should strengthen coordination and cooperation on major global and regional issues, such as the G20 affairs, climate change and the Iran nuclear issue, Bonne added.
