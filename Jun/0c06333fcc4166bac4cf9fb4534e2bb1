A dragon boat race is to be held from June 7 to 9 at a Yellow River wetland park of Bayannur City, in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, organizers said here on Thursday. A total of 15 teams from Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia and other parts of China will take to the river to celebrate the annual Dragon Boat Festival which falls on Friday this year. Each team will be composed of 12 paddlers, with the winners to be awarded 4,300 US dollars, organizers added. The three-day event will also feature a series of other activities, including a fitness show and ethnic Mongolian dancing. Dragon boat racing is a traditional event most often seen in south China, though in recent years, the event has also become popular in the country's northern regions.
