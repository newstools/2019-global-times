 China successfully sent a new satellite into the space to join the country's home developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, or BDS. The satellite was aboard a Long March-3B carrier rocket that was launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan Province at 2:09 am Tuesday.  The new satellite is the 21st satellite in the BDS-3 array of satellites, and the 46th in the BDS satellite family. It is the second BDS-3 satellite that will work in an inclined geosynchronous Earth orbit. Such latest development of the BDS-3 would further improve the coverage and service of China's satellite navigation system, according to an official press release from the China Satellite Navigation Office issued Monday.  The launch also marked the 307th mission of the Long March carrier rocket series.
