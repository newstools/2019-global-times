With the help of RealBeats AI, the chip supports 24x7 heart arrhythmia detection and telemedicine guidance services."Hardware is the foundation of products, but real intelligent hardware must have healthy cloud services to help users better maintain a healthy body," Huang Wang, co-founder and CEO of Huami, said in Beijing.As a supplier under Xiaomi Group, Huami is well known for designing and manufacturing wearable bands, but its own brand Amazfit is also developing fast.The company's wearable products in the first quarter of this year shipped 5.6 million units, earning revenue of 799.6 million yuan ($115.55 million), with an increase of 36.5 percent year-on-year, and its net profits totaled more than 95 million yuan. Income from Huami's own brand Amazfit increased by 62 percent.IDC data released on Tuesday showed that China's wearable device market for adult watches was 2.01 million units in the first quarter of this year, a year-on-year increase of 89.4 percent. Among them, Huami accounted for 17.1 percent, ranking second following Huawei. Huang said in an interview that Huami does not require its own brand to account for a certain proportion of shipments, but the company tries to be well-rounded, not only by developing sales channels but also by strengthening its tech ecosystem.Huami was listed in the US in 2017. "Since listing, Huami faces even greater challenges, and its rivals are giants, such as Apple," Huang said, but he believes that the company has its own advantages in sports and healthcare, and the company has been increasing investment in research and development and building a healthy ecosystem.
