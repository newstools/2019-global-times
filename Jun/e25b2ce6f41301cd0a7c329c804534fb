The Indian government on Sunday rejected a US State Department religious report, seeing no credibility in a "foreign entity" pronouncing "on the state of our citizens' constitutionally protected rights.""India is proud of its secular credentials ... The Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens, including its minority communities," India's foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a statement."It is widely acknowledged that India is a vibrant democracy where the Constitution provides protection of religious freedom, and where democratic governance and rule of law further promote and protect the fundamental rights," Kumar said."We see no locus standi for a foreign entity/government to pronounce on the state of our citizens' constitutionally protected rights," Kumar said.
