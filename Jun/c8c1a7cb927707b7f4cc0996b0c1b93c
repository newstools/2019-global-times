As China-US tension escalates, Chinese travelers may hold certain concerns about traveling there.After uncertainty over Huawei, the pre-planned event to launch the 2019 China-New Zealand Year of Tourism, which had been scheduled to take place on February 20 at Te Papa in Wellington, New Zealand, was postponed to March 31. The rescheduling meant it missed the opportunity to benefit a high season for Chinese travelers.The delay of the launch event had an obvious impact, said Xu Xiaolei, manager of marketing at China Youth Travel Services, one of the largest travel agencies in the country."The tourism industry is very sensitive to political relations" between other countries and China, Xu said. "Chinese travelers will show their sentiment toward a certain country in their consumption," Xu added."They know which country is friendly and warm to them."A white-collar worker surnamed Guo in Beijing told the Global Times on Thursday that she has had a standing invitation since last year from a college classmate studying in New Zealand, and she expects to find a good package from travel operators this year to go there. But she also wants to be sure the country is safe and friendly to visit. "I hope New Zealand gets the message Chinese travelers sent," Zhang said.
