In a speech at the fifth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, Chinese President Xi Jinping has put forward proposals and expressed China's stance on how to cope with common challenges, build an Asian community of shared future and create a better future.In his speech, President Xi Jinping has called on CICA members to build an Asia featuring mutual respect and trust, security and stability, development and prosperity, openness and inclusiveness, as well as cooperation and innovation. He's calling for more to be done to solve four "deficits" in global affairs, namely the deficits in trust, peace, development and governance.To solve the trust deficit, Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of mutual respect and mutual trust, saying everyone needs to respect each other's respective choice of political systems and development paths, while discarding the zero-sum game mentality and protectionism so political trust and consensus can thrive.To solve the peace deficit, Xi Jinping argues that to build a safe and stable Asia, there should be dialogue rather than confrontation, as well as partnerships rather than alliances among CICA members. He says CICA members need to be firm in cracking down on terrorism and extinguishing extremism, saying CICA members need to explore a regional security structure with Asian features to make a safer Asian continent.To solve the development deficit, Xi Jinping says development is key to all problems, saying countries in Asia and beyond need to work together to promote trade and investment liberalization, as well as finalize documents for regional integration such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. He says the Chinese side is working to synergize the Belt and Road Initiative with the development strategies of other countries, while also working to try to connect nations and promote high-quality economic development.Facing a governance deficit being compounded by increased unilateralism, protectionism and de-globalization, Xi Jinping says CICA members need to adopt a vision of civilizations based on equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness, while expanding people-to-people exchanges inside and outside the region, replace civilization superiority with diversified coexistence, replace civilization clashes with harmonious symbiosis, replace civilization estrangement with exchanges and sharing, and replace civilization rigidity with joint prosperity and progress.The Chinese President has also used his speech at the CICA to remind the other leaders at the event that as a member of the Asian family and a responsible major country in the international community, China will continue to be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order. He says China wants to spearhead this change in international relations to create a community with a shared future for mankind.Xi Jinping has also told the CICA session in Dushanbe that China will maintain a peaceful development path, vowing never to seek benefits at the expense of others. He says China will be maintaining its opening-up and win-win approach to international affairs. He says the country wants to share its development opportunities with others, inject powerful momentum into their common development through platforms such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the China International Import Expo. He has also outlined a governance vision based around consultation, joint contributions and shared benefits, saying China intends to staunchly protect the international system, with the United Nations at its core, and firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core. He's told the CICA session that China remains opposed to protectionism and unilateralism, and will protect international fairness and justice by protecting the legitimate right to development for all countries.As a multilateral forum focusing on security, the CICA's mandate is to help create a peaceful, safe and stable Asia by bringing together the various member-states to talk and build trust among one another. President Xi Jinping's speech, as well as China's contributions to the CICA over the years, shows China's willingness to help other CICA members pursue peace, stability and prosperity by promoting dialogue and cooperation. By doing so, each member of the CICA can work together to find opportunities and overcome challenges, creating a better future for Asia and the world.
