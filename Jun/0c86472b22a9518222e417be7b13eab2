Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan met here Wednesday with Egypt's Parliament Speaker Ali Abdel-Aal, calling for joint efforts to deepen cooperation in various fields. Wang said in recent years, the two countries' heads of state have met several times to provide strong political guidance and a guarantee for China-Egypt relations in the new era. China and Egypt are good friends and partners, both of which have experienced suffering and glory in history, he said, adding that now the two countries are seeking national rejuvenation, and the bilateral relationship has regional and global influence. Noting the two countries share broad common interests, Wang called on the two sides to jointly seize opportunities and cope with challenges, further expand and deepen cooperation in various fields and support each other's core concerns. "China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Egypt under the framework of the African Union and the Arab League," said Wang. Ali said the Egyptian side cherishes the friendship with China, appreciates China's development achievements and has broad consensus on developing a comprehensive strategic partnership with China, adding that the Egyptian side is ready to promote mutually beneficial cooperation with China.
