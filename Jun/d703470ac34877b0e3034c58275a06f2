At the invitation of Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese president, Kim Jong-un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), paid an unofficial visit to China in March 2018.

The last state visit made by a Chinese president to the country was in 2005 by then Chinese president Hu Jintao at the invitation of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.Zheng Jiyong, director of the center for Korean studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Monday that the visit will further improve the traditional friendship between the two countries and will also promote the peaceful solution of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue as North Korea and the US continue to face a deadlock following the unsuccessful summit in Hanoi, Vietnam three months ago."Due to sanctions based on UN Security Council resolutions and unilateral sanctions launched by the US and Japan, the North Korean economy and people's living conditions have been seriously damaged. North Korea desperately needs assistance from its most reliable neighbor to boost economic cooperation without violating UN resolutions," Zheng noted.North Korea is also interested in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and discussing concrete plans to include North Korea in the BRI and encouraging Pyongyang to insist on denuclearization and focus on economic development could also be a key topic at the upcoming visit, Zheng said.The annual G20 summit will take place in Osaka, Japan from June 28 to 29, and Chinese observers believe that making such a significant diplomatic move  about a week ahead of the G20 shows that China is trying to further highlight its unique influence in mediating between the US and North Korea.North Korea-US ties are in a deadlock following the Hanoi summit, and the Chinese leader will likely meet the leaders of the two countries before the end of June, so China is creating an important chance for the key parties of the nuclear issue to break their deadlock, Zheng said."There is no country like China with a unique and important influence over the peninsula issue, and this diplomatic move could also stabilize China-US relations, since the US also needs China's cooperation to push the peninsula's peace process," Zheng noted.
