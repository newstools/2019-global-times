Chinese police have investigated more than 100 criminal cases of exam cheating and confiscated about 2,000 sets of equipment used ahead of the national college entrance exam that started Friday. Police in north China's Tianjin Municipality detained 12 suspects for helping students to cheat in the national college entrance exam, while police in Shandong and Hebei provinces also captured more than 50 suspects and seized a large amount of wireless equipment, said the Ministry of Education in a document posted at its website, quoting police sources. The police will step up the crackdown on criminal acts during the exam this year to safeguard exam order and maintain social justice, said the ministry.
