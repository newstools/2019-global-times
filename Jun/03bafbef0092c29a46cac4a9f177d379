Despite rising US harassment and assault, China's Huawei Technologies has doubled its 5G contacts outside China, continuing supplying major carriers in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Huawei has secured so far 50 5G contracts outside China market as of Tuesday, which is a gain of almost 50 percent from the 30 contracts reported at MWC19 held in Barcelona, Spain, in February, Ding Yun, a senior executive of Huawei, told a summit ahead of the launch of MWC19 Shanghai, which is the largest industry annual event in Asia. "Huawei has been doing fine, we have to make sure the continuity of our business, not by relying on inventory, but by investing on our core technologies ranging from chipset to modules to the operating system," Ding said. The Trump administration has been pressuring US allies to bar Huawei from global 5G rollout, however, countries like the UK and Spain appeared to ignore US clampdown and have launched 5G commercial networks empowered by Huawei base stations. "Currently, two-third of global existing 5G networks are powered by Huawei technologies," the senior executive said. He added that Huawei has just helped launch the 5G commercial network in Saudi Arabia.
