The country has also set a goal of completely eliminating absolute poverty by 2020. Officials and enterprises in China's agricultural sector reemphasized the importance of boosting development of the country's grain sector during an industry seminar held in Zhengzhou on Thursday, arguing that domestic food security would be a stabilizer for the national economy."To expand agricultural cooperation with countries like Russia, diversify import sources and expand planting areas of certain agricultural products such as soybeans will be vital to maintain food safety and make sure China could have an advantage in the trade war with the US," an industry representative who preferred to remain anonymous told the Global Times on Thursday.
