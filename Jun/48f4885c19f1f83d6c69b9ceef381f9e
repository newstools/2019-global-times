Michael Jackson fans demonstrate in front of the Dutch television station NPO against the broadcast of documentary Leaving Neverland in Hilversum, The Netherlands, on March 8.

Staff at Madame Tussauds say Jackson's waxwork remains a top draw.  Yet according to the groundbreaking HBO documentary Leaving Neverland, released earlier this year, just a few hours' drive from the heart of Hollywood Jackson used his celebrity and glamor to molest young boys at his fairytale-themed ranch.While most fans who spoke to AFP were aware of the documentary, the adoration fostered from growing up with the "Thriller" megastar's many hits supersedes all else."I came here actually only for him. I don't take pictures with any other star," said Dutch tourist Hooman Nazemi."Some stuff that they were saying in the doc was kind of hard, but you cannot say 100 percent it's true... I just love him. I love him and I think everybody does."Antoine Baynes, 31, a Jackson impersonator who moonwalks along Hollywood Boulevard for tourists' tips, said the allegations had done nothing to diminish his performances' appeal - in fact, the opposite."After the HBO special came out I received just as much if not more attention than before. It kinda gave it publicity," he said."Honestly I've married people as Michael Jackson. I have two weddings to do this Sunday, to do as Michael Jackson!"The claims in the HBO documentary by two men who say Jackson sexually abused them for years as minors were not the first, but reignited the scandal after the star's fatal overdose at age 50 in 2009.In his lifetime, Jackson denied all child sex allegations and his estate filed a $100 million lawsuit against HBO for "posthumous character assassination."On Tuesday, the anniversary of Jackson's passing, die-hard fans from around the world have planned an "MJ Innocent Love Rally" through Hollywood to gather at his star on the sidewalk.Other events include a "zombie dance" on Venice Beach and screenings of fan-made tribute films.Yet numbers signing up to the events' Facebook pages are conspicuously low, and pro-Jackson messageboards are rife with complaints about the lack of mainstream enthusiasm for anniversary events this year.If the controversy has dampened commemorations, Jackson's commercial clout remains substantial. T-shirts, keyrings and coasters bearing the singer's likeness remain on prominent display at Hollywood tourist stores lining the boulevard. Of a dozen such shops visited by AFP, only one had removed Jackson memorabilia from its shelves, citing a decline in interest.
