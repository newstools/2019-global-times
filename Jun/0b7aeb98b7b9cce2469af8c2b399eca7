A modern railway R&D center was launched Tuesday in the northern Italian industrial city of Turin by CRRC Tangshan to enhance bilateral railway transportation technology collaboration and innovation. The CRRC Tangshan Italy Modern Railway Transportation Technolog Joint R&D Center will be affiliated to Blue Engineering, an Italian company set up in 1993 and thrived in the fields of automotive, railway, aerospace, marine and information and communication technologies. In 2016, three Chinese companies -- CRRC Tangshan Co., Ltd, China National Transportation Equipment & Engineering Co., Ltd, and GenertecItalia -- invested in Blue Engineering, taking 60 percent, 15 percent and 5 percent of stake respectively. Dario Gallina, president of the Turin Entrepreneurs Association, said at the ceremony that the launch of the research center is a recognition by CRRC of the competence of Blue Engineering, adding that it will benefit other related companies in the industry. His views were shared by other guests, among them Turin Mayor Chiara Appendino, Piedmont region President Alberto Cirio and Turin Polytechnic University Rector Guido Saracco. Wang Jun, vice-president of CRRC, said the R&D center will help give new momentum to Italy's development by providing better job and development opportunities. As the world's largest supplier of rail transit equipment, CRRC has already set up R&D centers in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, South Africa and Turkey. Li Bin, minister counsellor for economic and commercial affairs at the Chinese Embassy in Italy, and Song Xuefeng, Chinese consul general in Milan, also attended the ceremony with around 500 other guests.
