Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to North Korea from June 20 to 21. This will be the first visit to North Korea by China's top leader in 14 years and Xi's first visit to North Korea after Kim visited China four times within a year.

To bring in a third party or bring back a multilateral mechanism is the solution when bilateral dialogue is deadlocked due to low mutual trust."The Six-Party Talks proved that international cooperation can effectively reach an agreement on the peninsula issue with the September 19 Joint Statement in 2005 that the six parties - China, North Korea, the US, South Korea, Russia and Japan - issued in Beijing, Lü said. Maybe it is time to bring back a multilateral mechanism to push forward the peace process, he concluded.In the long term, if relevant parties want to solve the peninsula issue, the key is to integrate North Korea into regional development and make North Korea a part of the Northeast Asian community that shares common interests, Wang said.To underwrite North Korea's stability and development which is a shared and common regional interest, at least three neighbors - China, Russia and South Korea - could invest joint efforts in North Korea's economic potential or launch multilateral cooperation under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, Wang noted.Chinese experts believe that the China-North Korea relationship is entering a new era with higher mutual trust and closer cooperation, just as Xi wrote in his article quoting the Song of China-DPRK Friendship: "The great friendship and great common ideal we have make us invulnerably united."
