Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra Wednesday won a confidence vote for his government in the Congress, a significant step forward in pushing his anti-graft reforms. Vizcarra, who had asked the opposition-controlled Congress to take the vote, garnered 77 votes in favor, 44 against and three abstentions. The president celebrated on Twitter shortly after voting results came out, seeing them as lawmakers backing his anti-graft package, which includes measures to bar convicts of corruption from running for public office, straighten campaign finance, and withdraw immunity lawmakers have enjoyed facing anti-graft probe, among other things. "We will continue along the path that has been outlined," he tweeted. Lawmakers are expected to discuss the proposed bills for anti-graft reforms in the coming days. Prime Minister Salvador del Solar presented Congress with the proposals on Tuesday, followed by a heated debate lasting at least 9 hours. The proposals respond to a series of recent bribery scandals involving high officials from former presidents to supreme court judges.
