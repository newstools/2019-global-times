Over 90 percent of Chinese patients said they are generally satisfied with the medical services they received, according to a recent report. The report revealed that the overall satisfaction rates of outpatients and inpatients were 91 percent and 96.7 percent, respectively, in 2018, according to the Health News. The report was based on a survey jointly carried out by the public health school of the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and expert teams from over 30 provincial-level regions. The survey program started at the end of 2015. In 2018, the program mainly focused on the implementation and results of measures to improve the hospitals' services. Informatization measures in the hospitals surveyed have gained recognition from patients as the proportion of online registration has reached 60.7 percent in 2018 from 34.3 percent in 2016, said the newspaper. Progress has been made to address problems in healthcare accessibility and affordability, Liu Yuanli, dean of the PUMC public health school, was quoted as saying. Over 60 percent of pharmacists said they found the relations between doctors and patients in their hospitals are improving. However, Liu also noted that outpatients in the country's western regions showed a lower satisfaction rate than those in the eastern and central regions.
