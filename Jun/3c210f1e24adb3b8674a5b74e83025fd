An aerial view of the 108-meter-high elevator in a canyon scenic spot in Bijie, Southwest China's Guizhou Province Photo: VCGWu Hong, 29, and Li Fajiang, 27, are responsible for the maintenance work on a sightseeing elevator at a large canyon in Bijie, Southwest China's Guizhou Province.They have to check more than 30 parts of the 108-meter-high elevator, including the machine room, the shaft, the roof and bottom of the elevator, its fuel supply line and the wire lines, to make sure it is operating safely. They began doing this work on the first day of its operation in 2014. The elevator is the highest in Southwest China and helps save tourists time while sightseeing at the canyon scenic spot. The entire elevator "trip" usually takes 40 seconds. Summer is usually the peak time for the scenic spot. During this season, Wu and Li are busier than usual checking the elevator to make sure everything is safe.
