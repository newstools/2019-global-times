We must act across an array of sectors to address these challenges," he said.Moreover, the secretary-general said through implementing the provisions of UNCLOS, many challenges facing the oceans can be addressed, thus calling on the countries that have not yet ratified or acceded to the convention to do so.He also appealed to all states parties to "approach the task of the convention's full implementation with renewed commitment and vigour."
