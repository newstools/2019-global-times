China firmly opposes to any attempts by any country to use products made with China's rare-earth resources to curb China's development, an official said on Monday."We have been promptly studying policies and measures to give full play to the special value of rare earths, which is our strategic resource," Meng Wei, spokesperson of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's top economic planner, said on Monday."China has been actively upholding the multilateral system of free trade. However, mutually beneficial relationships need to be maintained by all parties involved. We are firmly opposed to certain countries disregarding world trade rules and undermining global industrial trade links," Meng said.Global industrial trade links are closely interconnected and no progress can be made without cooperation. China will promote its rare-earth industry in the principle of openness, coordination and sharing, to meet the world's legitimate needs for rare-earth resources and products, she said.In order to promote the high-quality development of China's rare-earth industry, effective methods including export restrictions, supervision strengthening, establishing a tracing and reviewing mechanism and accelerating high-end technology applications, would be considered, she noted.
