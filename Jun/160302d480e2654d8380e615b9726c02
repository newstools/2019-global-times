The two sides gave contradicting interpretations on whether the report proved that the Trump administration obstructed justice.On a separate issue, the US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform is set to vote Wednesday to determine whether to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for defying congressional subpoenas regarding a citizenship question in the 2020 census.
