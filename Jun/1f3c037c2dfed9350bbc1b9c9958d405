These gangs differ from normal ones because they aim to disturb the region's social stability and prosperity rather than make money, Xiong noted.Zhu noted at the briefing that cracking down on gang crimes in Tibet should be integrated with the fight against separatist forces, according to the Lahsa government website.  However, he told the Global Times on Tuesday that the campaign in Tibet is aimed at people involved in organized crimes, which is no different from  those in other parts of China, in response to some foreign media reports that groundlessly implied that the campaign in Tibet is targeted at people with religious beliefs or with ethnic backgrounds. "We strongly oppose and resolutely crack down on any separatist force in the name of ethnicity or religion, which are mainly organized by the Dalai clique," he noted.A work report from the head of Tibet's High People's Court in January said that 360 people in 268 cases were found guilty during the region's crackdown on gang crimes in 2018. Another 25 people were also punished for inciting separatism or financial crimes which jeopardized national security.Newspaper headline: Crackdown on separatism crimes
