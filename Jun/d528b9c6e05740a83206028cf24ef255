Experts have urged Beijing authorities to pay more attention to population structure following a recent report indicating a drop in Beijing's resident numbers. Compared with the average annual growth rate of permanent residents in other cities in the country, the population for Beijing turns out lower measured over the same period, according to the latest blue paper on Beijing social governance and development jointly launched by Beijing Academy of Social Sciences (BASS) and Social Sciences Academic Press on Wednesday. As urbanization continues, population expansion takes place, but the trend will not be permanent, Li Xiaozhuang, an associate research fellow with BASS told the Global Times."Most importantly, the size of the population does not fully explain the population problem. The core issue is population structure," he stressed. From Li's point of view, the focus of the work in megacities should shift from controlling the population scale to optimizing the population structure. In 2016, Beijing was home to a permanent resident migrant population of 8.07 million, and in 2017, the number fell into 7.94 million, official data from Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics shows. Taking factors such as the average salary, consumption ability and employment into account, the floating population in Beijing is more inclined to settle down in the capital. In particular, 95.9 percent of those who signed housing contracts in the city said they were more willing to stay, Li said. However, there are also concerns about the surging costs for both daily living and housing, according to Li.To achieve the goals stated in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), the residential population in Beijing aims to be below 23 million in 2020, a target that the blue paper finds will be difficult to reach.
