The tiny country now has 17 reservoirs that collect the rain that falls on two-thirds of its land area.It is testing smart water meters that use wireless technology and immediately detect excessive usage or leaks.And it invested in five wastewater recycling plants that now provide 40 percent of Singapore's water needs - a figure the city-state hopes will rise to 55 percent by 2060.Ever more cities worldwide recycle wastewater but whether every drop can be reused depends on the attitude of users, said Cecilia Tortajada, senior research fellow at the Institute of Water Policy at the National University of Singapore.While industries may be happy to use recycled water, not everyone is as happy to drink it. To further shore up supplies, Singapore also turns seawater into drinking water.It opened its first desalination plant in 2005, and now has three, with two more due by 2020. The plants working today can provide up to 30 percent of Singapore's water demand, PUB said.Desalination requires lots of energy - one reason it is not more widely used around the world.But new technologies and greater use of renewable energy mean PUB thinks it can halve its desalination power needs and make sure more of the energy is clean.Water independence?Today, the possibility that Singapore could become totally self-sufficient and give up imports is no longer unthinkable, said King Wang Poon, director of the Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at Singapore University of Technology and Design.The biggest barrier may actually be the low cost of water from Malaysia, said Gabriel Eckstein, president of the International Water Resources Association.Singapore's increasingly successful push for water security is, however, unlikely to be repeated in other Asian cities any time soon, said Tortajada of the Institute for Water Policy.Lack of cash, pollution, corruption and inefficiency all stand in the way, she and other water experts said.Singapore's focus on innovation and its flexibility, she said, are key to its progress."There is a lot of [water] policy innovation in Singapore, which is something you don't normally see," she said.And despite its rigorous system of planning, she said Singapore was "not afraid to change the plan. If something doesn't work, they adapt and modify it."Aiming lowerBack at his apartment, Reutens-Tan said Singapore's initiatives to conserve water were good first steps but PUB, the national water agency, must be more aggressive to hit its conservation targets.To cut daily usage to its aim of 130 liters per person, water experts say Singapore will need to impose even stricter restrictions and higher prices on its nearly 6 million residents.Reutens-Tan doesn't think Malaysia would ever turn off the tap - cultural and economic links between the two countries make it unlikely, he said - but he does see climate change and future droughts in the Johor River as a big threat.Newspaper headline: Precious trickle
