The Wednesday announcement of the new headquarters, according to Han, will support efforts to create an AI ecosystem that powers quality growth of the local economy. The investment firm disclosed Wednesday that it had closed the third yuan-denominated fund of 2.5 billion yuan ($361.78 million). The fund pertaining to Guangzhou will primarily invest in AI, big data, education, consumption upgrading, and business-to-business services, according to Sinovation Ventures, which manages about 15 billion yuan in US dollar and yuan funds. It's worth noting that the investment firm's research and development (R&D) capabilities, and global partnerships in academic terms, are a critical part of its ambition to become an important contributor to the bay economy, industry watchers said.Sinovation Ventures has been pushing for academic exchanges and continuing various exchanges with international science and technology R&D platforms, Wang Yonggang, executive director of Sinovation Ventures AI Institute, told the Global Times Wednesday. The investment firm has played an active role in setting global AI technology standards, according to Wang, who revealed that its Greater Bay Area research institute will be more open to scientific exchanges via Hong Kong.Huawei is among a group of global and domestic technology companies that Sinovation Ventures is cooperating with to nurture AI talent.
