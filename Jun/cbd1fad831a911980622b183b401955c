China's tech giant Huawei will invest 100 billion US dollars in the next five years to make network infrastructure more efficient and reliable, Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said Monday.

Ren made the remark when having a dialogue with US futurist George Gilder and Nicholas Negroponte, co-founder of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, at Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen.
