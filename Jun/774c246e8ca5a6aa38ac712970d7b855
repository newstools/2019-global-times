Two more people have died of seasonal influenza A/H1N1, bringing the total number of deaths to five across Myanmar so far, an official from the Ministry of Health and Sports told the media Thursday. "Four of them were from Yangon region while one six-month-old infant died in Sagaing region. Most of them include young child and elderly who had also suffered from weak resistance, diabetes and hypertension," said Dr. Thida Hla, deputy director-general of medical services department under the ministry. So far, a total of 12 people were confirmed to have contracted with the H1N1 virus out of 48 suspected patients as of Wednesday, she added. The symptoms of H1N1 include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headaches, chills as well as vomiting and diarrhea. The symptoms come within one to five days which is called incubation period after exposure to the infected person as the virus is spread through airborne droplets from sneezing and coughing or by hands which are contaminated with secretions, the ministry's release said. Prevention and control of H1N1 virus to reduce the risk of fatality from the virus is being carried out by the health authorities, who urged people to follow recommended precautionary measure. In July 2017, at least 30 people were infected with seasonal influenza A/H1N1-2009 across Myanmar, claiming at least six lives.
