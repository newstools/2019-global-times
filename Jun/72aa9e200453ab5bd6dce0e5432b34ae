But her clients are very much in the minority, as young people continue to leave the economic stagnation of the countryside for better prospects in the city.While 85 percent of Spain's territory is made up of rural areas, only 20 percent of the population live in them, according to a recent report by the European Association for Information on Local Development, a nonprofit based in Brussels.The European Union considers an area "sparsely populated," and therefore at risk of depopulation, when it has fewer than eight residents per square kilometer.When the population in an area thins out drastically, the remaining residents can face "a lack of economic dynamism and limited access to services and infrastructures," an issue that has now reached a "critical point," the AEIDL report warned."What is really lacking is a vision of the potential that rural areas have in today's world," said Soto of the ENRD.He noted that Spain's abandoned villages could be repurposed to house large projects, such as commercial production sites or 3D-printing facilities, at a fraction of what it would cost to keep them in a city.'Spaces of opportunity'Some of Spain's policymakers see reversing depopulation as a priority in the country, where official census data showed that in 2017 deaths outpaced births at the fastest rate since records began in 1941.Depopulation is "one of the most complex demographic and territorial processes affecting Spain, and it requires more decisive action," said Ignacio Molina de la Torre, director of the government's Commission for the Demographic Challenge. The government recognizes the need to turn rural areas into "spaces of opportunity" that take advantage of local resources, De la Torre said. To do this, it needs to improve digital connectivity, repurpose industrial spaces and repopulate residential areas, among other measures, he stressed.The government also plans to set up anti-depopulation offices in areas that "require urgent action due to their economic and social vulnerability," he added.Revival effortsConcerns over the emptying of rural Spain are driving several revival initiatives to try to bring people back to the countryside.The Living Villages project offers free information and guidance to anyone considering a move to the countryside, including help find a property, work and social contacts.A three-year trial of the project, which began in 2016 in the arid northeastern region of Aragon, will finish later this year.So far, about 25 families have used the service to relocate, mostly from Spanish cities but also from France and Latin America, said Patricia Sanchon, a manager at the nonprofit CEDER Somontano, which runs Living Villages.A similar initiative, New Paths, run by the Cepaim Foundation, rehouses African migrant families in Spain's abandoned villages.The project helps the parents find new jobs as shepherds or handymen, giving them the chance to become what the group's website calls "the agents of the revitalization and development of rural communities."Empty and dilapidatedPablo Nuno wanted to play his own part in revitalizing the countryside when he bought a large 12th-century farmhouse in a tiny hamlet north of Barcelona nearly 20 years ago. His plan was to turn the house in Molins de Rei into a hotel, to bring visitors and business back to the area, but he was eventually put off by the strict regulations on the listed building.Two years ago, Nuno, a 78-year-old entrepreneur, sold the house to a French family. But today it sits empty and dilapidated, with two or three smaller properties and a medieval church as its only neighbors.Nuno lamented the emptying of rural areas that he has witnessed over his lifetime, including the village where he grew up a few hundred kilometers from the farmhouse.He remembered there being more than 600 people living in his village when he was young. Now there are closer to 100 residents.Nuno's failed attempt to give new life to even a small part of Spain's emptying countryside has left him saddened and frustrated."I bought the farmhouse for its history, as an investment and to set up a business," he said. "But it was very hard to get off the ground." Newspaper headline: Secluded charm
