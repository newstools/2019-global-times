Surveillance cameras have ballooned at many roads in the downtown area.Â Seven more surveillance equipment were installed in Dongcheng's Dongjiaominxiang, previously known as "embassy row," which now includes a Beijing cultural relics protection block.The public surveillance network can help improve Beijing's public security, supervise traffic violations, and prevent and crack down on crime, said Wang Hongwei, a professor at Renmin University of China's School of Public Administration and Policy.Wang also brushed off privacy concerns saying that security authorities have a strict approval process to collect surveillance data and strict regulations on surveillance management to protect privacy and uphold the public interest.
