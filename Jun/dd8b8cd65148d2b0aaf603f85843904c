China has launched a series of events to promote the country's national anthem in middle schools and primary schools nationwide. The events are to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, according to a circular jointly released by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Ministry of Education and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The events run from late May to the end of October, when students learn how to sing the national anthem, take part in singing competitions and produce videos of them singing the anthem and other patriotic songs, some of which will go into a selection. Middle schools and primary schools across the country should further normalize and ritualize flag-raising and anthem-singing events, and local authorities should make efforts to start a heatwave of singing the national anthem via the events, in order to create a rich celebratory atmosphere, according to the circular.
