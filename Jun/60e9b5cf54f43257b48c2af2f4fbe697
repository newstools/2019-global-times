China will receive the first batch of whole frozen durian from Malaysia after the country's authorities cleared the fruit for export, Malaysian Agriculture and Agro-based Minister Salahuddin Ayub said Monday.Speaking at the flag-off ceremony at his ministry, Salahuddin explained the successful venture would greatly boost the amount of Malaysian durian shipped to China, as previously only paste and products could be sent to the country, with 238 tons being sent in 2018."With the export of whole frozen durian today, a new phenomenon will begin in China. The ministry estimates that at least 1,000 tons, mainly of the premium varieties, will be available in the Chinese market. The value of exports is estimated to be 500 million ringgit ($119 million)," Salahuddin said.Salahuddin reassured Chinese importers that there was an abundant supply of the fruit as the government had embarked on large-scale commercial growing of durians, with production going from 211,000 tons in 2017 to 341,000 tons in 2018.He also urged Malaysian farmers and businesses to maintain high standards in the fruits being shipped over to ensure sustainable trade, to ­enable the fruit to become a primary Malaysian export and also to take advantage of promoting the fruit for agro-tourism.
