Thomas Bach gave modern meaning to the ancient Greek idea of Olympic Truce," Papandreou said.He praised Bach for his key role in promoting peace, for the inclusion of a refugees' team in the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics and for the participation of a joint DPR Korea-South Korea team in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Games."Initiatives like the Cem-Papandreou peace award are even more relevant today, given the challenges of confrontation, polarization and identity politics worldwide. We hope that the award will also inspire new generations who will champion and prioritize peace and coexistence," Ipek Cem-Taha, Cem's daughter, stressed in a videotaped message.The story of Papandreou-Cem is connected in many ways to what the Olympic Games are all about, Bach said in his acceptance speech."It is about overcoming obstacles, achieving the impossible. It is about bringing people together. It is about the most precious human value. It is about peace," he said."Our mission today is to uphold the ideals and values of the ancient Olympic Games and adapt them to modern age," he underlined."The Olympic Games cannot prevent wars and conflicts, but by bringing all people together in peaceful competition, the Olympic Games show us what the world could look like," Bach concluded.
