"This environment's uncertainty shakes our members' confidence and discourages them from making further investments in the US"In the name of protecting domestic industries, Washington has placed steep tariffs on billions of US dollars' worth of products from China, a heavy blow to the two countries' economic and trade relations.According to the New York-based group, Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States, whose "exponential growth" started in 2013 and peaked in 2016 and 2017, "dropped drastically" in 2018 and early 2019.So far this year, Chinese FDI in the United States declined by 90 percent from its highest level in 2016, the report said.Companies with a 2018 annual revenue of less than 5 million US dollars make the biggest chunk, or 43 percent, of all that responded to the survey, while those whose revenue surpassed 100 million dollars accounted for 21 percent.

Only 1 percent said they will exit the US market.Facing challenges such as barriers on employment-based visas and immigration program, escalating protectionism in the United States, slow US economic growth, and unstable US policy toward foreign investment, Chinese companies in the United States are utilizing third-party services to improve business performances, it said.Some 65 percent of the respondents said they cooperate with third-party organizations to better comply with regulations, 48 percent said they will spend more on third-party services to cope with volatile global economic conditions and rising trade protectionism, and 26 percent said they cooperate with human resources agencies to address relevant challenges.The survey "clearly demonstrates that Chinese companies hold substantial interests in the US," Chen said, adding that Chinese investments "translate into substantial job creation and economic growth" in the United States.Since 2005, CGCC members have invested over 120 billion dollars in the United States, and employed "an estimated 200,000 people" in the country, Chen said.Most of Chinese companies start their US operation through greenfield investment -- establishing a new business entity rather than acquiring an existing one, said the report."As the overall Chinese investment flow to the United States plummeted significantly in the past two years, the volume of greenfield projects seemed to show strong resistance, staying on track of robust and stable progression at a level of about one to two billion dollars a year," it said."Chinese companies reinvest their earnings in the US market, make full use of the US services sector, purchase American-made products and develop bonds with local communities that have a powerful social impact," said Chen.Echoing Chen's words, Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, also said the report "reminds us that Chinese investment in the United States creates jobs and economic opportunities for hundreds of thousands of American citizens."
