China will roll out the revised negative lists for foreign investment market access by the end of this month, the country's commerce ministry said Thursday. The new lists, one for the piloted free trade zones and one for the rest of the country, will expand the fields open to overseas investment, Gao Feng, a spokesperson with the Ministry of Commerce, told a press conference. Revision work is now underway, and the ministry will further research related issues and expand reforms to create a fairer, more stable, transparent and predictable investment environment, Gao said. The negative list for market access outlines sectors, fields and businesses off-limits for investors. Industries, fields and businesses not on the list are open for investment to all market players. China announced the 2018 versions of the negative lists in December.
