A 5G network will also cover the airport. More than 60 Chinese and overseas carriers - including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and China United Airlines - plan to operate from the airport, according to a note the airport sent to the Global Times.China United Airlines, a wholly owned subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines, became the first to move into the new airport from its old headquarters at Beijing Nanyuan Airport, China Eastern said on Friday. China Eastern told the Global Times that it will transfer 80 percent of the flights now serving Beijing Capital International Airport to Beijing Daxing International Airport before the summer flying season of 2020, except for 46 daily flights between Beijing and Shanghai. By then, China Eastern will fly more than 334 flights per day out of the new airport, serving a network of 150 routes and 115 domestic and foreign destinations.China Southern Airlines, the largest carrier by fleet size in China, said on Saturday that it completed the maintenance facility at the new airport. The carrier, which is expected to handle 40 percent of the passengers at the Daxing facility, has built Asia's largest hangars, operational control center and aviation food production base.From October this year, Air China will also have more routes flying from Daxing to cities including Chongqing, Shanghai and Kunming in Southwest China's Yunnan Province. Finnair said on Wednesday that it will add capacity to Beijing with three weekly flights from the Daxing airport, the first overseas carrier to have such routes from both airports in Beijing.The new airport terminal is the world's largest single terminal building with a construction space of approximately 1.4 million square meters. With an investment of 80 billion yuan ($11.6 billion), the new airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers annually by 2021 and 72 million by 2025.
