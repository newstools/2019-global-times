The Islamic Summit starting on Friday in the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca discussed unified stance on events in the Islamic world, Al Arabiya TV reported. The 14th summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) this year is titled "Mecca Summit: Together for the Future," with the attendance of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and several heads of state from the Islamic world. The main topics for the summit focused on the issues of Palestine, Islamophobia, countering extremism and terrorism, and the situation of Muslims around the world. During the opening speech, King Salman highlighted that the Palestinian issue remains the priority of the OIC's work. "We reaffirm our unequivocal rejection of any measures that would affect the historical and legal status of Jerusalem," he said. In December 2017, US President Donald Trump declared that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the city in May last year, which made the relations between the United States and the Palestinian Authority deteriorated. In addition, the Trump administration has been preparing for a new peace plan called "Deal of the Century" to end the prolonged Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which the Palestinians have repeatedly voiced their rejection. The OIC summit was held following two Gulf and Arab summits in Mecca on Thursday to discuss recent regional developments and measures to be taken regarding them.
