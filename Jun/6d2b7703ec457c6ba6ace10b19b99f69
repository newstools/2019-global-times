On Thursday, the Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.38 percent, while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index surged 2.34 percent."This is a positive sign because it shows both sides are at least willing to meet and talk about it," Li Yong, deputy chair of Beijing-based Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, told the Global Times on Thursday. But he said recent US actions have made it very difficult for both sides to reach a reasonable agreement.Since trade talks broke down last month, the US has adopted a maximum pressure approach with China, increasing tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, blacklisting Chinese telecom Huawei and threatening to slap tariffs on about $300 billion in Chinese goods.

If the two sides keep this way, the meeting will lead to nowhere," Huo told the Global Times on Thursday, noting that the ball is in the US court. Even after the Tuesday phone call, US officials have continued with tough rhetoric and actions against China. At a US Senate hearing on Tuesday, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer suggested that talks and even tariffs alone might not work, Reuters reported. The US also appears to be moving forward with additional tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods by holding a public hearing, despite widespread opposition from hundreds of US businesses.Such actions from US officials have added to China's quickly evaporating patience and trust with the US, and further confirmed China's realization that the real US intention is to contain China's economic and technological rise rather than address trade issues, analysts said."After this round of clashes, we should be clearer about the future path of our own development, and though there is still the possibility of cooperation, we must also consider going it alone," Li said.
