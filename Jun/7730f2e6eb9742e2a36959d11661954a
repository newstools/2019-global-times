They are also considering tariffs on auto imports, which could target their European and Asian allies such as Germany and Japan."If the US is consistent on one thing, it's the bullying tactic. It not only uses that against China, but also a host of other countries," said Li Yong, deputy chair of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade. "For its own political purposes, the US has disrupted other countries' economies and the global economy as a whole," Li told the Global Times on Wednesday. China pushbackChinese officials have been pushing back US accusations in recent days. On Sunday, China issued a white paper on its position on the China-US trade talks, revealing in great detail how the US backtracked in negotiations three times.In March 2018, after the two sides held several rounds of talks and agreed on expanding China's imports of US agricultural and energy products, the US released the so-called Section 301 report criticizing China's trade practices and announced a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods.In May 2018, just days after the two sides agreed to put the trade war on hold after talks in Washington, the US resumed tariffs on Chinese goods and slapped a tariff of 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods.And then in the latest case, after several rounds of talks where the two sides agreed on most issues and were close to a deal, the US broke a consensus reached by leaders of the two countries in December 2018 by raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and blacklisted Chinese telecom firm Huawei.During the trade talks, the US insisted on "unreasonable" demands, including terms that violate China's sovereignty, according to Wang Shouwen, a vice commerce minister who is part of the Chinese negotiating team. Wang said at a press briefing on Sunday that even after China overcame difficulties to find pragmatic solutions to many issues raised by the US, "it still wanted a yard after China offered an inch."In a statement on Tuesday in response to the Chinese white paper, the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) largely repeated previous accusations that China walked back on promises during the negotiations and conducted unfair trade practices."The latest US statement is nothing but singing the same old tune again," Geng Shuang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press briefing on Tuesday. "Its accusation of China's 'backpedaling' is merely an attempt to distort the facts and blame the innocent party for its own wrongdoing," Geng said.
