Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman blamed Iran for attacks on oil tankers in a vital Gulf shipping channel, despite Iran's vehement denial, adding he "won't hesitate" to tackle any threats to the kingdom, according to an interview published on Sunday.Two tankers were struck by explosions on Thursday in the Gulf of Oman, the second attack in a month in the strategic shipping lane amid a tense US-Iran standoff, sparking fears of a regional conflagration and sending oil prices soaring."We do not want a war in the region... But we won't hesitate to deal with any threat to our people, our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our vital interests," Prince Mohammed told pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat, in his first public comments since the attacks.Thursday's attack on two tankers - the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous that was carrying highly flammable methanol when it was rocked by explosions and the Norwegian-operated Front Altair - came around the time Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was meeting with Iranian leaders in Tehran.US President Donald Trump has said the twin attacks had Iran "written all over it," rejecting Tehran's vehement denial.Saudi Arabia, a close US ally, is a bitter regional rival of Iran.The US military on Friday released grainy footage it said showed an Iranian patrol boat removing an "unexploded limpet mine" from one of the tankers.The UAE's Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Saturday called on world powers "to secure international navigation and access to energy," a plea echoed by regional ally Saudi Arabia after the incident sent crude prices soaring.Iran has repeatedly warned in the past that it could block the strategic Hormuz Strait in a relatively low-tech, high-impact countermeasure to any attack by the US.Doing so would disrupt oil tankers traveling out of the Gulf region to the Indian Ocean and global export routes. The UAE's Sheikh Abdullah, whose country is bitterly opposed to Iranian influence in the region, called for a deescalation of tensions."We remain hopeful in attaining a broader framework for cooperation with Iran," he said at a summit in Bulgaria.
