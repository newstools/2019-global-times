A male employee of Facebook Inc. died Thursday after jumping off from a building at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, a city in Silicon Valley, police authorities said. The Menlo Park Police Department said police officers responded to a 911 emergency report that an adult male jumped off the fourth floor of a building in the 100 block of Jefferson Drive and found the victim "unresponsive" when they arrived at the scene. "Firefighters and paramedics administered medical aid but were unable to revive the victim. The victim was pronounced deceased at the scene," the police said. A preliminary probe by the police indicted that "there is no foul play involved in this apparent suicide." The police said the identity of the victim would not be released until his next of kin is notified. Facebook is "saddened to learn that one of our employees passed away at our Menlo Park headquarters earlier today," the company said in a statement to local media. It promised to cooperate with police investigation into the incident.
