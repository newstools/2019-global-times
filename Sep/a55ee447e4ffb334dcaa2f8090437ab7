Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council The Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council praised Solomon Islands on Tuesday after the country ended "diplomatic ties" with the island of Taiwan on Monday, saying that the decision will benefit the country's people and the one-China principle in an overwhelming global trend of recognition. There is only one China in the world, to which the island of Taiwan is an inalienable part. That is a basic fact and the general consensus of the international community, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the office, said on Tuesday. Ma also slammed Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s accusations of "dollar diplomacy" and "political suppression" as a complete self-deception which only aims to divert attention.  The DPP's attempts to sow discord between China and the rest of the world are doomed to fail and China will never rescind the one-China principle, and this is clear to anyone with an international perspective and common sense, Ma stressed. Ma noted that the DPP is responsible for the current situation, as it has undermined the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations and the common political ground established by the "1992 Consensus." The 1992 Consensus is the only choice to safeguard the interests and well-being of compatriots in Taiwan and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, Ma added. Global Times
