Residents buy pork at a local market in Yunyang, Southwest China's Chongqing on Thursday. Photo: ICChina on Thursday moved to tap its state pork reserves to ensure steady supply ahead of the National Day holiday peak season, as pork prices have been skyrocketing from strained supplies caused by the outbreak of African swine fever.The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said it released 10,000 tons of pork from the state reserves into the market as part of a contingency plan to manage periodical fluctuations in pork prices. The move was meant to increase pork supply and ensure supply during the seven-day holiday, according to a MOFCOM statement. It noted that pork prices in the country have increased significantly, though demand is dropping. On Wednesday, wholesale pork prices at major markets rose by 0.1 percent from the previous day, but 1.3 percent higher than September 10."The MOFCOM will closely monitor changes to pork prices and supply and demand… and continue to release state pork reserves when appropriate to ensure supply," the statement said.Faced with rising prices and strained supplies, some local governments have already tapped into their reserves to ensure market stability. On Saturday, the provincial government of East China's Zhejiang Province released a batch of pork from its reserves priced 30 percent lower than market prices, according to media reports. It was unclear how much pork the province released.
