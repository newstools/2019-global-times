The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said on Thursday that HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam will attend the first Community Dialogue session on the evening of Sept. 26, and 150 people from the community will be invited to the dialogue. Lam, together with some principal officials of the HKSAR government, will attend the first Community Dialogue session from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium, Wan Chai, on Sept. 26. The session will be an open dialogue platform aimed at reaching out to the public to invite people from all walks of life to express their views to the government, so as to fathom the discontent in society and to look for solutions, the HKSAR government said. It also said that the session was open for public registration and interested participants may submit their registration forms online from Thursday to noon on Sept. 23. The session has an admission quota of 150 places, it said, adding that should the number of registrants exceed the quota, places will be allocated by computer lot drawing, and successful applicants will be notified on or before Sept. 24. Lam said in a televised speech on Sept. 4 that the HKSAR government will take four actions to find a way out of the current impasse for Hong Kong, including she and principle officials of the HKSAR government reaching out to the community to hold direct dialogues.
