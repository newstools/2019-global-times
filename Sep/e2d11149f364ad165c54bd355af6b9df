Members of the Israeli Druze community arrive to vote in Israel's parliamentary elections on Tuesday, in Daliyat al-karmel, northern Israel.

Without that, Netanyahu would already be prime minister."After exit polls were released on Tuesday night, Lieberman called for a unity government with his party, Likud and Blue and White, saying the country was facing an "emergency."The election was the second in five months for Israel, and President Reuven Rivlin, who must choose someone to form the next government, said there was a "need to avoid a third."
