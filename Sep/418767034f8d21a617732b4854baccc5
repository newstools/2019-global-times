Photo: ICThe popularity of domestic brands has been surging over the past decade along with a continuous trend of consumption upgrading, and it's more common to see distinctly Chinese cultural symbols in the consumer market, surveys have shown.The overall progress in technology, quality, design and social values of domestic products in all sectors represents the process of moving from "Made in China" to "Pride of China," said a survey published ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.The percentage of searches for Chinese brands among searches of all global brands on China's largest search engine Baidu grew from 38 percent in 2009 to 70 percent now, a survey jointly carried out by people. cn and Baidu showed.Among six industries covered by the survey, the electronics and information industry saw the fastest growth (37 percent), followed by the culture and entertainment industry (36 percent).The changes of key terms related to each industry on the search platform showed the improved image of Chinese brands during the past 10 years.The key related terms of the electronics and information industry in 2009 were "cheap, contract manufacturing, white label, Made-in-China and quality problems," but this shifted to "good cost performance, independent research and development, intelligent manufacturing and best-seller" in 2019.The key words in the culture and entertainment industry in 2009 were "introduction, anti-piracy, box-office crisis and culture creative transition," while now they are "original, exclusive copyrights and box office champion."The increase in new consumption trends and popular topics related to cultural symbols like the Palace Museum and Huawei show that "national brands" have become a new driver of China's consumption upgrade, the survey said.Rising awareness of local products has been a boon for Chinese brands, a study of China's consumption trend in the second quarter of this year released by Nielsen in August showed.The study showed 68 percent of Chinese consumers prefer domestic products, as national consciousness has been rising. Even though 62 percent of buyers would purchase international brands, domestic brands remained the first choice.Product quality improvements and business model innovations brought about by technological progress are essential to Chinese brands' rise, Zhang Yi, CEO of Shenzhen-based iiMedia Research, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Having roots in China's traditional culture is another core competiveness of domestic brands, Zhang added.In a survey of "national trends" iiMedia Research released in June, the institution said that rising national cultural confidence and patriotic sentiment amid the bruising China-US trade war have all catalyzed the rise of national brands.To further improve Chinese brands' images, the path of innovation-driven development must be persistently followed. Only in this way can the brands improve core competitiveness, according to experts."Innovation needs to be made both in research and development to raise product quality, and also to make changes in businesses' operating models," Yuan Fuhua, director of the economic growth office of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.More complete industry standards should be formulated to protect and support domestic brands, and more small and medium-size companies specialized in certain areas should be fostered, Yuan added.
