But this year the disease was found in 56 out of 77 districts," he said.Warmer conditions help spread the disease both by making it easier for mosquitoes to reproduce, and by spurring the virus itself to replicate faster.But "migration of infected mosquitoes and human cases from the tropical parts [of Nepal] plays a role in seeding the disease" in new areas, he said.Because there is no vaccine or particular medicine to treat dengue, reducing the number of mosquitoes is the main way to reduce its spread, Dhimal said.But Nepal's government, ­confronted with a fast-rising threat, so far has not put in place enough programs to do that, he said."As the highlands were rarely previously affected by dengue, people and government official are not well-prepared to prevent and control the disease." In most cases, efforts to battle the problem start "only after it has gained ground," he said. That means "the insects that are not eliminated this year will [lay eggs and] surge again next year after it starts getting to a favorable temperature," Dhimal said.Another obstacle in controlling the disease is simply the lack of awareness of many people about the emerging threat.For example, residents may protect themselves against mosquito bites at night, but not the dengue-carrying mosquito bites during the day, something few people in Kathmandu know, he said.A study he led in 2012 found people in lowland Nepal were five times more likely than people in highland areas to understand dengue risks.If highland Nepal is to successfully fight back against dengue, "awareness of people and control of the vector by effective government action and community mobilization can be the only effective step," Dhimal said.Newspaper headline: Fevered pitch
