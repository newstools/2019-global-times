The aircraft and the 'rainbow' it dragged were wonderful," A Beijing resident surnamed Wang told the Global Times on Sunday."I'm really proud of my country and its development over the past decades. I'm looking forward to the actual parade on October 1," she said.The photos and videos went viral. The Sina Weibo post by the People's Daily gained 20,000 likes in only about two hours."My adrenalin was pumping. Go China!!!" reads a typical comment by net users.Other netizens recalled the founding ceremony held on October 1, 1949, when Zhou Enlai, the first premier of the PRC, asked warplanes to fly over Tiananmen Square twice because of their limited number, according to China Youth Daily.  "There are as many warplanes as you want now." "This flourishing age must be what you have envisioned back then, premier Zhou," were typical comments that received a lot of 'likes' on social media.There have been two other rehearsals in downtown Beijing, which took place over the previous two weekends of September, but aircraft formations did not attract as much attention as they did on Sunday.
