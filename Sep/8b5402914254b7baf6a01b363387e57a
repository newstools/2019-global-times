It was established in 2015 to recognize those scientists whose original research conducted mostly in China in fields like life science, physics and mathematics,  and computer science that has made a significant impact on the international science community, regardless of their nationality, gender, or age.By promoting basic research and scientific talents in the region, the prize is set to inspire society's love for science, respect for scientists, and attention to scientific and technological developments, according to a statement sent to the Global Times by the prize committee on Saturday. The cash award for the Future Science Prize in each category is $1 million, donated by four individual philanthropists to each of the category.Wang Yifang and Luk Kam-biu won the Future Science Prize in physical sciences for the experimental discovery of a new type of neutrino oscillations. Wang Xiaoyun won the prize in mathematics and computer science, for her seminal contributions to cryptography by innovating cryptanalysis methods to reveal weaknesses of widely used hash functions.Wang is the first female scientist who has won a Future Science Prize award. Global Times
