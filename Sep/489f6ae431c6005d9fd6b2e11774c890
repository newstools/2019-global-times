The white paper, titled "Seeking Happiness for People: 70 Years of Progress on Human Rights in China," was released by the State Council Information Office. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, targeted measures have been taken to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of ethnic minority groups, women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities, ensuring their equal status and giving them the equal opportunity to participate in social life, said the white paper. China effectively guarantees the rights of ethnic minority groups in administering state affairs, enables the ethnic minorities and ethnic minority areas to leapfrog in social and economic development, as well as education, the white paper said. The freedom of ethnic minorities to use and develop their own spoken and written languages is fully protected, their cultural heritage and relics are effectively protected, and religious freedoms of ethnic minority groups are protected, according to the white paper. China has improved the protection of women and children's rights to health, and women's rights to participation in the administration of public affairs and social and economic development, the document said. The mechanism for protecting the rights and interests of the elderly is improving, it said. China has also improved the social security system for persons with disabilities, made rehabilitation universally available to them, ensured their right to employment and given strong support to creating an accessible environment and providing assistive appliances, the white paper said.
