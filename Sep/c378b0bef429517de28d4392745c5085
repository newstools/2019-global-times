The meeting was mediated by the Finnish presidency of the Council of the EU. European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos was also present for the migration mini-summit.The position paper will be presented to the other members during the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting scheduled for Oct. 8 in Luxembourg.Avramopoulos described the framework as a "predictable and structure set of temporary arrangements" which would kick in every time a migrant vessel is rescued at sea."I find it crucial that we move away from ship-by-ship arrangements towards a more predictable solution," Finland's Interior Minister Maria Ohisalo said."Upon approval, countries have to come forth and volunteer as places for disembarkation, and others who accept will participate in relocation," said Maltese Minister of Home Affairs and National Security Michael Farrugia.He added that the mechanism proposed is aimed at not leaving frontline countries "alone".In comments he gave to the Maltese media, Farrugia said that the members will have a chance to agree, disagree or propose amendments to the position paper agreed upon on Monday.
