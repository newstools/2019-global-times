He and his wife have lived in Xinjiang their whole lives. Feng said her parents love everything about Xinjiang, which has also had a great influence in her life.When her mother was painting at home, she would play Xinjiang folk song "Mudanhan," which Feng still loves today."Xinjiang is always in my blood," she said.
