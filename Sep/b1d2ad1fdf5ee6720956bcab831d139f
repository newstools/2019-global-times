(Photo: Xinhua)Two Arizona artists who refused to create invitations to same-sex weddings due to their Christian beliefs were within their legal rights, the US state's top court ruled Monday.The decision invalidates previous judgments against the two women for violating a "human relations ordinance" introduced by the southwestern city of Phoenix to safeguard LGBTQ rights. According to their lawyers, the two artists could have faced up to six months in prison and a $2,500 fine each time they refused to make invitations to gay weddings.Joanna Duka and Breanna Koski, owners of a small calligraphy company specializing in handwritten invitations, opened legal proceedings against the city in 2016 over the ordinance. The pair claim their Christian faith prevents them from promoting same-sex marriage, including by making invitation cards. Phoenix's ordinance would compel them to violate their freedom of expression and religion, they argued.While the judges did not generalize their ruling to cover all commercial activity, gay rights advocates warned it sets the stage for further legal battles.
