These actions will be recorded and a remote supervisor will be alerted, who will contact the driver in time to eliminate the dangerous behavior.When students get on and get off the bus, they will need to swipe their cards, which are also connected to their parents' smartphones. With each swipe, the parents will be notified that their children have got on or got off the bus, so that they know the children have not been left behind.The smart bus also has an infrared life detection system. Once the bus is locked, it will check if there are any vital signs still in the vehicle. If a student is locked in the bus, the system will automatically sound an alarm, take photos and report to a monitoring platform.Chongyang county also required school bus drivers to take extra training and examinations before receiving a certificate to drive the students, the report said.China has experienced fatal school bus traffic accidents and tragedies involving children who have been forgotten and locked in school buses. Global Times
