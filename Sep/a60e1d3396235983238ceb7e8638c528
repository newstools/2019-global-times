Fake meatballs displayed at a trade fair of merchants on Alibaba's e-commerce platform Taobao pique visitors' curiosity in Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang Province on Monday. The domestically developed fake meat products debuted at another Taobao trade fair in September, and now they're on many Chinese dinner tables.

So a mature process matters as well."Moreover, the possible arrival of Impossible Foods triggered another discussion over whether synthetic meat improved food safety as pork prices soar."Synthetic meat will not replace real meat in the near future in terms of taste and nutrition," Zhu Danpeng said. "So the soaring prices of pork meat will not pave the way for fake meat."Even if the price of pork overtakes Moutai at 1,500 yuan ($166) a bottle, many Chinese would still prefer "real meat," Zhu Danpeng joked."For Chinese, taste is very important," she said.
