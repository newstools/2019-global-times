Photo: Screenshot from video by Pear Video.Police are investigating an unusual traffic incident brought to their attention by a video posted on social media showing a woman and a toddler driving a child's go-kart on a busy highway.  A local resident shot the video, which appears to have been taken from another moving vehicle, and shared it in a WeChat group. Members of the group say they've seen the woman's dangerous stunt before and so they sent the video to police of Fuzhou, East China's Fujian Province. Police told Pear Video go-karts are not allowed on a highway and the woman is seriously endangering the child's life, which is also a punishable offense.Net users were outraged at the woman, who they believe to be the child's grandmother. "A go-kart is too low for drivers to detect. A crash would be disastrous. Every family member has the responsibility of setting a good example for their children," a Weibo user commented.  Pear Video
