"And now we are ready to begin a new era of relations with China," he said.Taiwan, under international law, is not entitled to diplomatic relations with any sovereign country in the world because it is not recognized as a country by the United Nations, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said in a statement on Friday.

According to analysts this will accelerate the pace of more countries establishing diplomatic ties with the mainland and acknowledging one-China principle is an irreversible trend in the global community. "Establishing diplomatic ties with the mainland will also stimulate those in the Pacific that still maintain 'diplomatic relations' with Taiwan island, which may lead to a 'domino effect' among them," Xie Bohua, former Chinese ambassador to Vanuatu, told the Global Times on Saturday. Two countries severing ties with the island of Taiwan in a week is also seen as "a major blow" to Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's office, as many observers and politicians have been questioning Tsai's policies and her competency to maintain a healthy cross-strait relation as well as maintaining the stability of Taiwan's external affairs. Taiwan's 'diplomatic unrest'Since Tsai took the office in 2016, growing number of countries including severed ties with Taiwan, setting a new record as the regional leader who saw the highest number of countries ending "diplomatic relations" with the island.

Now, deepened ties will offer  greater business and growth opportunities to the Pacific Island country, which will help create more development synergies in the region. In 2018, China-Solomon Island reached a total volume of 2 billion Solomon Island dollars ($242 million), with China being the largest single trading partner surpassing other partners of the Soloman Islands in total trade volume.
