In March this year, doctors from the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan provided online guidance for a surgery on a Beninese patient with a thyroid tumor."The China-Benin telemedicine cooperation center is only the first step. We hope to cooperate with more countries along the routes of BRI to help provide better healthcare," Ma said.At an international conference on "internet plus healthcare" held in Yinchuan on Friday, representatives from China and various Arab countries reached a consensus that the two sides should deepen cooperation in the use of internet technologies to improve medical services.The conference is part of the ongoing 4th China-Arab States Expo, which was held last week."The health of people around the world is still facing serious threats and challenges," Mao Qun'an, head of the planning and informatization department of China's National Health Commission, said at the event, adding that China is willing to work with Arab states to promote pragmatic cooperation in "internet plus healthcare" for the benefit of people from both sides.Thus far, China has signed healthcare cooperation documents with 13 Arab League countries and has launched a spate of cooperative projects in areas of disease prevention and control, public medical system construction, traditional medicine and talent training, according to Mao.Mahmoud Hassan Elamin, director of the Representative Office of the Arab League in Beijing, said at the conference that "internet plus healthcare" is the newest area of China-Arab cooperation.He said that online medical services and artificial intelligence can help people from less-developed regions in Arab countries who still have to travel far to big cities for better medical treatment.China issued a guideline in April last year to enhance the role of the internet in medical care, calling for the use of internet technologies to improve the quality of public health services. Ningxia is building the country's first "internet plus healthcare" demonstration zone, including a big data center and a healthcare industrial park.
