The airport advised passengers to make use of public transport when traveling to the airport.Trains to the airport were also suspended on Sunday due to threats from the radical protesters.The protesters are participating in an unauthorized assembly, and since an injunction is still in force, the protesters may be liable to be charged with contempt of court, according to a statement Hong Kong police released on Sunday.The police have warned all protesters to stop their illegal acts and leave immediately.After days of disturbances and violence by unlawful assemblies at the airport, the Airport Authority Hong Kong obtained on August 13 an interim injunction from the court to restrain persons from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of Hong Kong International Airport, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
