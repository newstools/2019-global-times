Punishments were not specified in the document. Limited station resources cannot fully support so many visitors, Zhang said, noting that the guideline could draw a line between tourism and  research.The Great Wall is China's first research station in Antarctica and has been in operation since 1985. It was a one-floor building when first built, and the "No.1 Building" covered most functions including dining, living and research. After 34 years of development, the station is now a complex of more than 20 buildings. The "No.1 Building" has become a museum that showcases the history of China's exploration of Antarctica.
