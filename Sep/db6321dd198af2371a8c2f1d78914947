The SCO Secretary-general Vladimir Norov met the representatives and gave a speech in which he outlined the functions and missions of the SCO and the challenges that it must face together with the rest of the world. Norov highlighted several important issues, such as terrorism and the trade war, which he said the SCO is against and greatly concerned about. "The world is changing, and we are facing different challenges. SCO is against nationalism and trade wars and these are against the peaceful vision of SCO countries," he said.
