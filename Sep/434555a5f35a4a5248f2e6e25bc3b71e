(Xinhua/Iqbal Lubis)Mass prayers are expected later in the day to remember victims of the 7.5 magnitude quake and subsequent deluge that razed swathes of the coastal city on Sulawesi island last September.Some 4,300 people were listed as dead or missing while nearly 60,000 people are still living in makeshift accommodation after their homes were destroyed, according to the Red Cross.The force of the impact saw entire neighborhoods leveled by liquefaction - a process where the ground starts behaving like a liquid and swallows up the earth like quicksand.It also destroyed fishing boats, shops and irrigation systems, robbing locals of their income.Hundreds of damaged schools "are so badly affected they remain too dangerous to use, forcing children to learn in temporary classrooms where they have to attend in shifts due to a lack of space," Save the Children said Saturday.Earlier the World Bank offered the country up to $1 billion in loans to get the city back on its feet.Indonesia is one of the most disaster-prone nations on Earth due to its position straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide.Newspaper headline: Indonesia marks one year since deadly quake
