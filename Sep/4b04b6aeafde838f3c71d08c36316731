The participation rate of urban and rural basic medical insurance has exceeded 98 percent, and the number of urban and rural residents covered by the basic medical insurance now exceeds 1.35 billion.Moreover, national health and medical services continue to place emphasis on disease prevention. The per capita subsidy standard for basic public health services has been raised from 15 yuan in 2009 to 69 yuan in 2019. The service contents have been continuously expanded and service items have been gradually improved.Zhuang finally stressed that National Health Commission will continue to deepen grassroots medical reform, contributing to the building of a healthy China. The State Council has recently issued a guidance document on implementing the Healthy China Action Plan (2019-30). This indicates a nationwide health campaign has officially started.Global Times
