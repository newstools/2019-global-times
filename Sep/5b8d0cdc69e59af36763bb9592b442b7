The People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, successfully issued 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) of six-month yuan-denominated central bank bills in Hong Kong on Thursday, as part of the ef­fort to im­prove the yuan bond yield curve in Hong Kong and the internationalization of the yuan.  

 The move establishes the mechanism to issue central bank bills in Hong Kong, and assists the enrichment of the Hong Kong financial market with the high credit rating of yuan investment products and yuan liquidity management tools, according to a statement by the PBC. 
 The central bank aims to improve Hong Kong's yuan bond yield curve, to promote the development of the offshore yuan currency and bond markets, which will help the internationalization of the yuan.
 The offering of yuan-denominated central bank bills was well received by the market, and the subscription ratio reaching 3.6. The bid-winning interest rate of the 6 month yuan-dominated central bank bill, at 2.89 percent, is basically in line with the current offshore market interest rate of the same term.
 The total bidding amount exceeded 36 billion yuan. Buyers included commercial banks, central banks, funds, international financial organizations and other investors in the offshore market. 
 Since November last year, the PBC has issued 11 rounds of central bank bills worth 130 billion yuan in Hong Kong, with their terms varying at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. 
 In addition to the central bank, the Ministry of Finance also issued 5 billion yuan worth of Treasury bonds in Hong Kong on Wednesday, of which 4.5 billion yuan was issued to institutional investors and 500 million yuan to foreign central banks and regional monetary authorities.
