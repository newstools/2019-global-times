This shows the tremendous potential and scope for cooperation between China and Panama given the current downturn in world trade, said Wang.Wang said the Chinese side will encourage Chinese enterprises to actively participate in cooperation with Panama so as to benefit the two peoples.China will unswervingly consolidate and develop friendly relations with Panama, and is willing to work with Panama to lift bilateral relations to a new level, said Wang.Wang stressed that China's cooperation with Latin American countries including Panama is sincere and selfless as China never attaches any political conditions nor does it pursue any political or geopolitical interests.Latin America is a big stage for cooperation among countries rather than an arena for big power politics, Wang said, adding that China-Panama cooperation does not target any third party and should not be disturbed nor affected by a third party.During the meeting, Wang asked Ferrer to convey President Xi Jinping's cordial greetings to President Laurentino Cortizo. Ferrer conveyed Cortizo's sincere greetings and good wishes to Xi and extended warm congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.Ferrer said Panama attaches great importance to developing relations with China and will firmly abide by the one-China policy and be China's reliable partner forever.
