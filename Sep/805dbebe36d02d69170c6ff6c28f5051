"Defendants cannot simply ignore the dictates of the consent decree merely because they no longer agree with its approach as a matter of policy." Gee said attorneys for the government had failed to prove their case and could have sought Congressional action to reverse the Flores agreement."Having failed to obtain such relief, defendants cannot simply impose their will by promulgating regulations that abrogate the consent decree's most basic tenets," Gee said. "That violates the rule of law. And that this Court cannot permit."The Department of Justice said the administration was "disappointed" with the ruling and would continue to work "to restore integrity to our immigration system."A spokesperson called the Flores Agreement "outdated" and said "the government has done exactly what the Agreement required: Issue a comprehensive rule that will protect vulnerable children, maintain family unity, and ensure due process for those awaiting adjudication of their immigration claims."A coalition of 20 US states had filed suit against the Trump administration after it announced that it planned to scrap the Flores rule.Human rights groups had also criticized the proposed new rule and vowed to challenge it in court.Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a key part of his 2016 presidential campaign platform. In 2018, he launched a "zero tolerance" policy that saw more than 2,300 children separated from their parents at the border, before the government backed down amid a massive public outcry.
