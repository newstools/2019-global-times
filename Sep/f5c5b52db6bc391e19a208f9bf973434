Local media reported that students are planning a range of protests including skipping classes and illegal rallies.Students from 10 universities and colleges are said to boycott classes at the CUHK campus at 3 pm. The boycott is planned to last two weeks, according to media reports.Some students have already started protesting on Monday morning. Local media reported that students in three secondary schools at Chai Wan formed a human chain in front of campus at around 7 am.Global Times
