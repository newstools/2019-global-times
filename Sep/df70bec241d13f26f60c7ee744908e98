US President Donald TrumpÂ  (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)Forty-four members of the US Congress have urged President Donald Trump's trade representative to restore trade concessions to India, saying the withdrawal of the privilege had led to retaliatory tariffs from New Delhi which were hurting US industry.In June, the US ended its preferential trade treatment for India, removing it from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program that allowed duty-free entry for up to $5.6 billion worth of its annual exports to the US.The elimination of GSP brought higher retaliatory tariffs from New Delhi on 28 US products including almonds, apples and walnuts.In the letter addressed to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and dated September 17, the members of Congress said, "Just as US industries are harmed by lack of fair and reciprocal access to India's market, American companies and workers also are harmed by new tariffs due to the GSP termination."A lot of American jobs depend on the trade between India and the US, the US lawmakers said in the letter seen by Reuters.The letter comes days ahead of a meeting between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.After the Trump administration's decision to remove trade privileges from Indian products under the GSP, US and Indian trade negotiators met in July. But they failed to make any major progress on the issue of tariffs and other protectionist measures imposed by both sides.The two sides had resumed trade talks after Trump and Modi met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in June and agreed to seek to deepen the two countries relationship.Other than seeking the rollback of Indian tariffs imposed on agricultural products like almonds and apples, Washington has also expressed its concerns over India's tightening of regulations that have undermined major US e-commerce companies like Walmart's Flipkart and Amazon.India is by far the largest buyer of US almonds, paying $543 million for more than half of US almond exports in 2018, according to US Department of Agriculture. It is the second largest buyer of US apples, taking $156 million worth in 2018.On Sunday, Trump will travel to Houston, Texas, to participate in an event with Modi and to "discuss ways to deepen their energy and trade relationship."
