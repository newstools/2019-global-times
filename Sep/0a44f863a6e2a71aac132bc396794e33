(Xinhua/Wang Yiliang)China urged the United States to stop pushing a Tibet-related bill and cease using Tibet-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Thursday. Spokesperson Geng Shuang's remarks came after some US lawmakers introduced the so-called "the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019" in the House of Representatives. The act severely violates the basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and sends a seriously wrong signal to the separatist forces of "Tibetan Independence," Geng said at a press briefing, adding that China firmly opposed the move. Tibetan affairs are purely China's internal affairs and allow no foreign interference, he said, urging the United States to fully recognize the high sensitivity of Tibet-related issues and to stop using Tibet-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs.
