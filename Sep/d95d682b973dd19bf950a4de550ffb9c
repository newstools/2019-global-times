The Taliban killed at least five people in a fresh bombing in Kabul on Thursday in yet another horrific attack on the Afghan capital as the US and the insurgents negotiate a deal to see American troops leave the country.The blast shook Shash Darak, a heavily fortified area adjacent to the Green Zone and home to several important complexes including the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the Afghan intelligence service.The morning attack was also close to where the Islamic State group killed nine journalists in a blast in April last year, including AFP chief photographer Shah Marai. Farid Ahmad Karimi, general manager at Wazir Akbar Khan hospital close to the bomb site, told AFP that five bodies and 25 wounded people had been brought into the facility."There are both civilians and security personnel among dead and wounded. Five of the wounded are women," Karimi said.On Twitter, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, saying a "martyrdom seeker" - suicide bomber - had triggered the car bomb.Massoud Zazai, who owns a photo studio across the street from the blast site, said he was in his shop when the explosion happened."I fell off my chair and it got dark inside the shop because of smoke and dust," Zazai told AFP."I went out to the scene moments after the attack, the side of the road was littered with debris and bodies."Through the smoke, Zazai said he could hear injured people crying and calling for their mothers and brothers."I saw at least five very badly injured, one was covered in blood and not moving. It was horrifying."Interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said the blast had been caused by a car bomb at about 10:10 am (05:40 GMT).On Monday, at least 16 people were killed in a Taliban attack on a residential area in east Kabul.The capital has been gripped by a surge in deadly violence even after the US and the Taliban reached an agreement "in principle" that would see the Pentagon pull thousands of troops from Afghanistan in return for various Taliban security promises.
