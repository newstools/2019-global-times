They are not qualified to be fans of Liverpool or football," said a Liverpool fan on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The earlier post said the statement on the Facebook page, signed by 10 members, only represents club leaders' "personal opinion." "That is ironic. The fact is they were abusing the public account to voice their own radical political opinions twice. They are kidnapping other fans," said a Weibo user.  "The second post shows that some radical protesters from OLSCHK were cornered," An Yukang, a Beijing based cultural scholar, told the Global Times on Wednesday.An noted the headstrong behavior from some people at OLSCHK betrays the spirit of their beloved club, known as "You'll never walk alone." The fan group members who attack police officers and create separation in society are walking alone, An said.
