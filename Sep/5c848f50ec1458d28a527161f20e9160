May I ask, are you a student?" Xu said, dismissing the students' concerns. He noted that they had consulted the local public security bureau about privacy issues. The system does not invade personal privacy of students as the classrooms are public space, Xu said. The university has also installed face recognition systems at the school's gate and other buildings such as the library.The facial recognition systems will be installed in every classroom if the pilot program proves a success, Xu said. Meanwhile, the relevant topic has been viewed more than 40 million times as of press time on Sina Weibo.Many netizens don't support the school's decision and questioned that the face recognition system is abused in the university. "Why not get students' attention through improving the lesson quality," a netizen wrote.Global Times
