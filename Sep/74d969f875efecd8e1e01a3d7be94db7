A homage to the late Princess Diana was among the breathtaking shows that lit up the second full day of New York Fashion Week on Sunday.US designer Tory Burch, a paragon of Bohemian chic style, wowed the audience with soft floral prints and baggy, puffed-out sleeves that had a distinct 1980s feel.The 53-year-old, who presides over a clothing empire worth more than $1 billion in annual sales, said the Spring 2020 collection had been inspired by Princess Diana's personality rather than her wardrobe per se."I have always admired her and I wanted to tread very carefully because clearly, she's a style icon and I didn't want to reference that. But I felt she had a fearlessness and being a humanitarian that she was very inspiring," Burch told AFP. Princess Diana, known as Lady Diana Spencer before she married into Britain's royal family, was well-known for extensive charity work."She stands apart," Burch continued. "Her compassion, her integrity and her being a mom and going through difficult times in a public way that clearly she wasn't comfortable with. I can relate to that," added the thrice-married designer.  Burch said she was enjoying having her husband Pierre-Yves Roussel as CEO of her eponymous company, which he joined earlier this year after leaving luxury goods behemoth LVMH. "It's a huge relief. I've been doing it for 14 years and to be able to just work on product and brand has been very freeing for me," she said.
