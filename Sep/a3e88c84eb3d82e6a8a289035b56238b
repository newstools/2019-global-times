File photo: ICIran's Foreign Ministry on Sunday denied the "pointless" US claims that Iran is behind recent drone attacks on Saudi Arabia's Aramco oil establishments."Such accusations and useless blind viewpoints are meaningless and incomprehensible within the diplomatic norms," Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in a statement.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday blamed Iran for the attacks on two Aramco oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia. Pompeo's tweets came hours after Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the drone attacks.Mousavi said that the Yemenis have proved that they have resisted against aggressions and war crimes by the Saudi-led coalition for the past five years.He said that "the only way to end the useless crisis in Yemen and establish peace in the region is to halt the Saudi-led coalition's attacks and invasion, cut off western political and military support to the aggressors, and find political solutions."
