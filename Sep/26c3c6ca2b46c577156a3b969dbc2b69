Five crew members who were above deck on the bridge escaped the fire as passengers slept in the ship's lower quarters."This isn't a day that we wanted to wake up to for Labor Day and it's a very tragic event," Coast Guard Captain Monica Rochester told a news conference earlier on Monday, saying the search would continue throughout the night.Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown earlier told reporters eight bodies had been found on the ocean floor and in the area of the sunken vessel, which lies upside down under more than 60 feet of water.Authorities were trying to determine the best way to recover the sunken ­vessel, including the possibility of towing it to shore, Brown added.The surviving crew members sought refuge on a fishing boat moored a few hundred feet away, banging on the side to wake up Bob Hansen and his wife, who were sleeping onboard."When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern," Hansen said in an interview with The New York Times. "There were these explosions every few beats. You can't prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous."Scuba or propane tanks on the Conception may have exploded in the fire, but that had not been confirmed, Brown said, adding it was unclear if there was an initial explosion that caused the fire.After borrowing clothes from the Hansens, some crew members headed back toward the Conception to look for survivors without luck, Hansen said.US Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who represents California, called for an investigation.
