Oil prices continued to be capped by concerns over the slowdown of global economic growth, but a huge draw in US oil inventories, along with some bullish news such as a hurricane approaching Florida, a plunge of US active drilling rigs, as well as somewhat softened US vs China trade issue rhetoric and Russia's oil output cuts in August, provided floor for the prices.Oil prices declined on Monday after news came that a France-proposed meeting between top leaders of the United States and Iran might be possible.
