But consumers should not wait, and those who still can refund their cars should do it first, Li said.The consumer surnamed Zhang said that she thought Tesla was more likely holding the information back from consumers, and if it's true, the brand's integrity is facing questions.Responding to the complaint, Tesla on Tuesday said that it had not deliberately hidden information from consumers.Tesla's China head Zhu Xiaotong said that Tesla had applied for the tax exemption several times, but the company didn't have the right to make  public the information at the time, and it didn't have the power to decide if the application could be approved.But a lawyer said the company could have handled the matter better. Tesla could have made public the news of its application, Wang Zhengzhi, senior partner at Beijing-based Globe-Law, told the Global Times on Tuesday, adding that the company is suspected of violating consumers' rights to know.The company should make every effort to help consumers regarding the matter now, Wang said.
