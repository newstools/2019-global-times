The white paper, titled "Seeking Happiness for People: 70 Years of Progress on Human Rights in China," was released by the State Council Information Office. It said that after the founding of the People's Republic of China, socialist rule of law was established to protect human rights by law. Noting that a relatively complete legal system to protect human rights has been established in the country, the white paper said China upholds law-based governance, law-based exercise of power, and law-based government administration. To promote social fairness and justice, China has endeavored to ensure that a well-conceived approach is taken to legislation, that the law is strictly enforced, that justice is impartially administered, and that the law is observed by everyone, the white paper said. China has built a service-oriented government with limited powers and clear responsibilities, the white paper said. Efforts have been made to ensure independent and impartial exercise of judicial and procuratorial powers, guarantee the right to fair trial for all parties and the legitimate rights and interests of criminal suspects, defendants, prisoners, patients abstained from drugs and people released after serving their sentence, the white paper said. The system of right remedy and assistance is being improved, quality and more convenient public legal services are being provided, public awareness of legal protection of human rights is enhanced and corruption is being fought to safeguard people's interests, it said.
