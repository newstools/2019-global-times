Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif addresses a press conference in Helsinki, Finland, on August 19, 2019. (Xinhua/Matti Matikainen)Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned Thursday that a possible military strike on his country will lead to an "all-out war" in the region."I make a very serious statement about defending our country. I am making a very serious statement that we don't want to engage in a military confrontation," Zarif was quoted by Press TV as saying."We won't blink to defend our territory," the top Iranian diplomat vowed."Iran does not want war, but we will not hesitate to defend ourselves," Zarif said, adding that even a "limited strike" on Iran equals a war."Here's no such thing as a 'limited strike,'" he said.Zarif made the remarks as the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for being behind the attacks on two oil facilities of Saudi Arabia on Saturday.Yemeni Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia pointed the finger at Iran for sponsoring the attacks, citing the weapons used are Iranian-made.But the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which are still working to determine the launch sites for the attacks, have not determined how to respond to the attacks that have impacted the global energy supply by knocking out half of Saudi oil output.
