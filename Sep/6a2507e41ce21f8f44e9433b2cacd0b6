The vessel is 122.5 meters long and 22.3 meters wide, with a displacement of 13,996 tonnes and a navigation capability of 20,000 nautical miles. Xuelong 2 is able to turn quickly and has two-direction icebreaking capabilities with both its bow and stern. It can sail on 60-day expeditions to all regions of the globe, according to Hu Keyi, a technical director of Jiangnan Shipyard Group, the builder of the vessel. "Xuelong 2 will become a major platform for China's oceanic environmental survey and scientific research in polar regions," said Qin Weijia, a director in charge of polar research with the State Oceanic Administration.
