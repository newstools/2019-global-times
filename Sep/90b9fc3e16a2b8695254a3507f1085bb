South Korean singer and Big Bang member G-Dragon, Chinese supermodel Liu Wen and US singer Rihanna took the following three spots. According to Chen Lei from CBNData, different from Wu, Yue is good at mixed street styles, which are highly welcomed on China's online shopping platforms like taobao.com.  As the hottest brand favored by millions of fashionistas, Supreme topped the list in the designer/brand section, followed by  Kanye West's Yeezy, Champion, Clot and Off-White.  Fang Tao from Suntchi Brand & Technology, which owns Fashion Exchange, said on Tuesday, "We refer to these brands, artists, celebrities and influencers as Fashion IP, because we think they possess a unique style, a stable population of followers as well as the ability to design and influence  the public."
