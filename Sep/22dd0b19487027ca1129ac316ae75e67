It is not sufficient to only focus on function and safety in the design of subways nowadays. We also need to pay attention to giving these spaces an artistic touch." Many other participants agreed with Wang, noting that designers and urban planners should work toward the goal of promoting art by ensuring subway rides are pleasant experiences for the public.
