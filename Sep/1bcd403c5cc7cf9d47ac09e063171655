High schools and universities in China must conduct military training and offer national defense education courses, according to China's Military Service Law and National Defense Education Law.The issuance of the notice is timely and necessary as riots in Hong Kong continue to escalate, said Li Daguang, a professor at the National Defense University of the People's Liberation Army.Chinese schools should not only conduct military training but also daily   open courses to enhance students' love for the motherland and the military, Li told the Global Times on Monday."Improving teaching quality and innovating teaching methods for students to better understand national defense and patriotism are very important," Li said.Many Chinese schools have enhanced patriotic education as the new school semester started on Sunday, especially those in South China's Guangdong Province, which is located next to Hong Kong. Shenzhen University held a national flag-raising ceremony with 30,000 teachers and students in attendance Monday morning. A hastag on Sina Weibo of a program called The First Lesson: Five-star red flag, I am proud of you of China Central Television, the state broadcaster, aired Sunday night has been viewed nearly 2 billion times as of press time.
