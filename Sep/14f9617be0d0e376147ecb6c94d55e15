In 2018, China's total amount of imported soybeans dropped 7.9 percent to 88 million tons. The amount from the US plummeted 49.4 percent to 16.6 million tons.Besides boosting soybean production in northeastern China to increase self supply, the country is also diversifying its import sources.On Wednesday, China announced that imports of soymeal from Argentina would be allowed for the first time.Global Times
