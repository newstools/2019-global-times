It stipulates that Party organizations at the county level should have a member of the Party committee who is specifically responsible for the work. It requires Party publicity agencies be established in Party organizations within state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, and publicity departments should be established in Party branches in colleges and universities. The regulation asked Party committees and governments at all levels to strengthen the building county-level media integration centers. The construction, management and use of grass-roots level publicity institutes including public libraries, cultural venues, and museums were also emphasized in the regulation.While international public opinion and discourse is still driven by Western media, Chinese voices have become stronger. Clashes between the two pose challenges especially at the grass-roots levels, so it is urgent that malicious infiltration from the West be prevented, and to unwaveringly stick to the Chinese route and ideology, a Beijing-based media policy expert surnamed Luo, told the Global Times on Sunday.The analyst cited the recent unrest in Hong Kong as an example, saying that "the special administrative region is unique in certain ways, but the obvious lack of quality media work in the society, in particular in education institutions such as universities, to some extent, has led to the current chaos, among other causes."Analysts on Sunday commented that such a regulation on publicity is of great necessity, especially where Chinese publicity work is increasingly confronted with challenges from Western ideologies, and it is crucial to stick to the correct political course set by the Party and China.The regulation stipulates that publicity and communication work will be evaluated for their ideological accountability and discipline supervision system, which according to experts, "is to focus on the implementation stage," and they believe that such an evaluation will be conducted in a scientific fashion without adding unnecessary pressure on officials.A firefighter in Beijing, who is also in charge of his brigade's publicity work, told the Global Times on Sunday that the regulation may help raise awareness of the importance of publicity work by grass-roots departments. "Currently we are short of talent and training, such as proficiency in social media, which is a major channel to communicate with the public," said the firefighter who requested anonymity.Newspaper headline: Party orders units to step up publicity
