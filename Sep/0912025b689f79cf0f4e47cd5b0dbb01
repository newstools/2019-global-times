Huawei denied allegations that it has stolen smartphone-camera patents from an overseas investor by rolling out a detailed explanation statement, calling those allegations "false." It also stressed that the US government has been "using every tool at its disposal" to disrupt the business operations of Huawei. "We condemn the malign, concerted effort by the US government to discredit Huawei," the company said. The Chinese mobile phone firm made these explanations after the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials are looking into whether or not Huawei had stolen smartphone-camera technology from its Portuguese investor Rui Oliveira.In the statement, Huawei emphasized that it had never used Rui Oliveira's camera design, although representatives from Huawei's US subsidiary met with Oliveira upon his request in May 2014, on which occasion he pitched his camera design to Huawei. Huawei also made clear that its EnVizion 360 panoramic camera was independently designed by its own employees, and that its design was very different from Oliveira's. "It's clear that Mr. Oliveira is taking advantage of the current geopolitical situation. He is pushing a false narrative through the media in an attempt to capitalize on a dispute. This type of behavior should not be encouraged, nor should it be considered rational justification for a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice," read Huawei's statement. Global Times
