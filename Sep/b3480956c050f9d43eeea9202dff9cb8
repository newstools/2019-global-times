Cao Dewang, founder of China's largest vehicle glass manufacturer Fuyao Group, stressed the importance of the country's manufacturing competitiveness. "Manufacturing is the secondary industry, and only when the secondary industry is developed can there be demand for service industries," he said on Monday.The comment came after the recent debut of the documentary "American Factory," produced by Barack and Michelle Obama, which recorded Cao's journey as he built his factory in the US.Cao said Americans who were willing to work in factories were mostly older people, because young Americans prefer to work on Wall Street or at the Silicon Valley."Even though we offered a competitive salary, we could not recruit young workers," he said, adding that US manufacturing has faced decades of "hollowing" and lost a generation of workers.Cao mentioned three advantages of building factories in the US, including low cost resources, low taxes and fees and strong market demand. Meanwhile conflicts between labor unions and factory owners have caused industrial inefficiency.The Trump administration has been rolling out measures to attract its manufacturing enterprises back to the country.China maintains advantages in manufacturing, such as low labors cost, skilled workers and low cost industrial land, he said.Cao said manufacturing needs to be enhanced to ensure the employment and welfare of ordinary people."American Factory" traces Cao's story starting in 2015 after he bought a factory that had been shut down by US carmaker General Motors in Ohio. The Ohio factory was put into operation in 2016 and became profitable in 2017.
