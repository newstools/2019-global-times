The 4-week moving average also declined to 212,500, down 4,250 from the previous week's level.Total inventories of merchant wholesalers were 679.1 billion US dollars at the end of July, up 0.2 percent from the revised June level and up 7.1 percent from the revised July 2018 level, the Census Bureau said on Wednesday.Sales of merchant wholesalers in July registered 499.6 billion dollars, up 0.3 percent from the revised June level and virtually unchanged from the July 2018 level.The PPI for final demand rose 0.1 percent in August, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday. Yet the gain came lower than the 0.2 percent increase in July.The advance in final demand prices is attributable to a 0.3-percent increase in the index for final demand services in August. In contrast, prices for final demand goods fell 0.5 percent.The number of job openings was little changed at 7.2 million on the last business day of July, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Tuesday.
