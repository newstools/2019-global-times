The white paper, titled "Equality, Development and Sharing: Progress of Women's Cause in 70 Years Since New China's Founding," was released by the State Council Information Office. The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 ushered in a new era for women in China, changing their social status from an oppressed and enslaved group in the past thousands of years to masters of their own fate, the white paper said. As the Chinese nation is rising and growing richer and stronger, Chinese women's social status has undergone enormous changes, it said. As China's development has entered a new era, promoting gender equality and women's overall development at a higher level not only meets opportunities, but also has a long way to go, the white paper said. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, China will always adhere to safeguarding and improving women's livelihoods, promote women's all-round development, and lead hundreds of millions of women in working for national rejuvenation, it said. Besides a preface and a conclusion, the white paper consisted of nine sections: "Women's Cause Remains High Priority and Is Actively Promoted in China," "The Legal System for Protection of Women Rights Constantly Improved," "Women's Role in Economic and Social Development Becoming Increasingly Prominent," "Women's Political Status Has Grown Significantly," "Women's Education Level Has Risen Significantly," "Women's Health Condition Has Improved Dramatically," "Social Security for Women Continues to Improve," "Women Play Unique Role in Cultivation of Family Virtues," "Women Taking Part in Extensive International Exchanges and Cooperation Activities."
