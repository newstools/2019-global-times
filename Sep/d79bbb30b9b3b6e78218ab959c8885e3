Photo: Chen Qingqing/GTHuawei's founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei called for more tolerance and trust toward emerging new technologies, following US government crackdown on the company's 5G technology.  The Chinese tech giant has been facing mounting challenges over past months as the US government has put it and many of its affiliates on the Entity List, forbidding American firms from selling components and software to Huawei. Meanwhile, Washington has been lobbying other nations to shun Huawei in the 5G roll-out. "5G has sparked a lot of discussion. In fact, 5G is just a tool, and the history will tell this," Ren told a panel called "A Coffee with Ren," held on Thursday at the company's headquarters in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province. "China used to be very poor, and people didn't think China would catch up. Now we are doing quite good," he said, noting that people always show mistrust of new technologies.It takes time, he said, adding that Huawei is willing to sign "no backdoor" agreements with every country worldwide, and is confident that the company can gain trust. "Some countries in Europe have already given us many opportunities. I think that's very tolerant and we're satisfied… I can't make everyone understand us," Ren added.
