"I will let the back of my hands face the camera from now on and hide my fingertips," one netizen wrote.Some netizens are worried about other recognition technologies. "If displaying fingertips in photos can give away fingertip information, what about showing my face? My iris information can also be revealed and stolen by others to cheat iris recognition systems," another Weibo user commented.Zhang warned people not to disclose fingerprint information in photos posted online and not to leave fingerprint information at machines without confirming their purpose and whether they are legal. Zhang added that people should use both fingerprints and passwords to ensure safety, instead of relying only on fingerprints.The 2019 China Cybersecurity Week opened in Shanghai on Sunday to enhance people's awareness of network security and improve their ability to prevent network security threats.Global Times
