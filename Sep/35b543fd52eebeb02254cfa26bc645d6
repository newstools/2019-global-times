Bahamas authorities have updated the death toll from Hurricane Dorian to 50 with the number expected to climb, local media reported.

Fuel and water remain the biggest needs in Abaco," Smith said. So far, the death toll from monster storm Dorian is at 52, but officials say that number is likely to go up. About 1,300 people are still unaccounted for, but Smith said officials are working to cross-reference new data and locate the missing.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Saturday after traveling to the islands the day prior that Dorian demonstrated the need to address climate change."We have always had many hurricanes, but now they are more intense, frequent, and they are powered by climate change," he said. "We need to make sure that we reverse the present trend where climate change is running faster than what we are."
