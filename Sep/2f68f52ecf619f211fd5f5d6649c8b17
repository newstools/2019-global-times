"Living a happy life is the primary human right," the document said, adding that China regards the rights to subsistence and development as the primary and basic human rights and has been improving the rights of its people in a coordinated manner since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, especially after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012.

In the future, the Chinese people will certainly enjoy to the full more extensive rights and realize well-rounded development at higher levels, it said.The white paper noted that, in the new era, China will continue to uphold cultural diversity, communicate with and learn from other civilizations and work with the international community for common development and prosperity, for progress in human rights worldwide, and for building a community with a shared future for humanity.
