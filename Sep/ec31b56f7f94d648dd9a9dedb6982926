Among the 2,900 participants, Li Huizhou won first prize in category A concerning cultural communication and Fu Yongkang won first prize in category C, concerning the environment, out of 1,645 competing poster works."The Chinese designers' performance at the International Poster Biennial in Mexico reflects the richness in vision and drawing of the thousands of years of ancient cultural state [where they come from]," Bernal said. "With China, Mexico has called for graphic design and visual communication ways to social change and improve people's environmental awareness." Bernal added that just as in China, in Mexico, they have also adopted graphic designs and vision communication techniques as a way of calling for social changes.Founded in 1988, the International Poster Biennial in Mexico is one of the most well-established exhibitions in the field and has become a model for the world with its contribution to the practicability and development of posters.
