Saudi Arabia on Friday said it was offering tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative Islamic kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil.

We are opening our economy. We are opening our society," Khateeb said.Lacking the infrastructure to accommodate visitors, Saudi Arabia has splurged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch.Newspaper headline: Effort to kickstart tourism part of Vision 2030 program
