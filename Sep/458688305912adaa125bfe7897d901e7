The delegation outlined Xinjiang's development achievements, its important role in the Belt and Road Initiative and the historical causes of Xinjiang's problems.Xing Guangcheng, head of the delegation and director of the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said at the conference center that they have come to France to tell the truth about Xinjiang and make their voice heard to all walks of life in France.Sonia Bressler, a French writer and expert on China who attended the symposium, said that the Chinese delegation frankly addressed many groundless suspicions in Western public opinion. She believes that scholars from the two countries should strengthen exchanges and more French scholars should go to Xinjiang to find out the truth.After concluding its visit to France, the delegation will also go to the UK to exchange views with local communities.Global Times
