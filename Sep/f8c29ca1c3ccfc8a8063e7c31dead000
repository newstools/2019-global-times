The outbreak could worsen food shortages in North Korea, where, according to the World Food Programme, its output last year hit the lowest level since 2008.In May, the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization said pork prices had risen by up to 50 percent both in China and on the Chicago futures exchange as a result of the outbreak.Last month, it said almost 5 million pigs in Asia had died or been culled because of the spread of the disease.African swine fever, nearly 100 percent fatal to pigs though not harmful to humans, has spread throughout Asia - including to both Koreas and to Vietnam, Laos and the Philippines - since first being ­detected in China in mid-2018, resulting in large-scale culls and lower output of pork.
