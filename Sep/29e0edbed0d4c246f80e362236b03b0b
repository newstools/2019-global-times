It is only a handful of countries that requires international aid to scale up their primary health care," Salama said.Some $7.5 trillion is spent on health globally each year, according to the report, issued on the eve of a health summit at the UN General Assembly.Barely half of the world's 7.7 billion people are covered by essential health services, the report said, calling for doubling that figure.Yet if current trends continue, allowing for population growth, up to 5 billion people will miss out on health care in 2030, the target for universal health coverage set by world leaders in 2015, it said.About 925 million people spend more than 10 percent of their household income on healthcare, including 200 million people who spend more than 25 percent, the report said."It is quite shocking to see the increasing number of people which are at risk of poverty due to health spending," said Francesca Colombo, who heads the health division at the OECD."Even in high-income countries... there has been growth in the share and in the number of people who spend large proportions of their household budgets on health," she said.Primary health care must cover access to essential drugs including for diseases such as diabetes and malaria, said Muhammad Pate, global health director at the World Bank.
