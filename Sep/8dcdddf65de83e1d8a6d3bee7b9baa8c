Photo: Wang Wenwen/GTChina has strongly condemned the move on Wednesday by US congressional committees to advance a Hong Kong-related act, warning that the bill could harm bilateral relations as it blatantly interferes in China's domestic affairs. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 moved closer to becoming law after obtaining approval by both House and Senate committees. The bill, if passed, would sanction Chinese officials who are found to be "suppressing Hong Kong's democracy, human rights or citizen freedoms" by freezing their US assets and denying them entry to the US.China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday expressed its anger and firm opposition to the US approval of the bill. Geng Shuang, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, noted that the protests sweeping across Hong Kong triggered by an extradition bill have changed in essence. Incited by external and secessionist forces, Hong Kong's radical groups and rioters have wantonly damaged public facilities and attacked the police, and have gone far beyond what is allowed in normal demonstration and protest, Geng added.However, US houses have turned a blind eye to such maleficence and lent a helping hand to these radical forces and rioters, which exposes the evil purpose of certain US politicians to destabilize Hong Kong and contain China's development, Geng said.The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on Thursday also strongly condemned and firmly opposed the approval of the bill, which it said is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and a trampling of international law and relations principles.A handful of secessionists have begged for external interference and betrayed the country, and the disgrace of such acts will be remembered by history, the spokesperson of the office said."We urge the US Congress and certain politicians to stop their meddling on matters that will hurt China-US ties," the spokesperson noted.Begging for foreign interferenceOver the past three months, relentless Hong Kong protesters have resorted to foreign support. During various protests, protesters waved the flags of the US, the UK and even Germany as a means to appeal to these Western countries for help. During a protest on September 8, mass protesters called for US support outside the US consulate in Hong Kong, waving US flags and shouting slogans in English.In early August, Hong Kong secessionist activists Joshua Wong and Nathan Law were caught meeting with Julie Eadeh, a political unit chief of the US consulate in Hong Kong. Wong claimed that their discussion focused on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.Last week, US politicians including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Jim McGovern met with Wong and Denise Ho, a singer-actress activist, and invited them to testify at a Hong Kong-related hearing. Witman Hung Wai-man, principal liaison officer for Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Qianhai Authority, called the activists' move to drum up US support "absurd.""International politics is all about interests. By offering such 'support,' the US does not take Hong Kong people's interests into consideration. Meanwhile, begging for such support will only set Hong Kong's people in peril," Hung told the Global Times.
