Jordan - two of Hollywood's top black A-listers - co-star in Just Mercy, the true story of a black man put on death row in Alabama in 1988 for the murder of a young white woman he did not commit."We wanted to make sure people understand how tragic it is, and how commonplace it is - it happens all the time," said Foxx, who plays wrongfully convicted Walter McMillian.The Toronto International Film Festival, the largest film festival in North America, runs until Sunday. Newspaper headline: Toronto film fest kicks off
