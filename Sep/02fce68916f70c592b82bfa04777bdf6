Last week, the group said Chairman John Slosar will retire soon, against the background of some of its staff having been involved in recent riots in Hong Kong.The inbound Hong Kong traffic in August was down 38 percent while outbound traffic was down 12 percent year-on-year, and inbound traffic demand to Hong Kong from regional markets, particularly the Chinese mainland and North East Asia, was severely hit, Lam said. The company is reducing capacity growth such that it will be slightly down year-on-year for the 2019 winter season (from end-October 2019 to end-March 2020) versus the original growth plan of more than 6 percent for the period, the statement said.
