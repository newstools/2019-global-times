An oilfield in Daqing, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, in May Photo: ICSaturday's attack on Saudi oil facilities will have limited impact on China's crude supply as China, whose reliance on oil imports have declined in recent years, has made increased efforts to diversify its supply sources and boost the development of new energy, analysts said.The impact of the attack was reflected in soaring crude oil prices on global markets on Monday. Crude oil shares opened higher on Monday morning trading in A-share market, as seven industry firms including Geo-Jade Petroleum Corp, Tong Petrotech and XinJiang Beiken Energy Engineering Co reported share prices rising to their daily limit of 10 percent.Chinese state-owned oil major China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) saw share prices rise more than 4 percent in trading in Hong Kong on Monday and Sinopec Group reported shares jumping 3.5 percent on the Shanghai bourse.Brent crude futures opened nearly 10 percent higher on Monday, and then surged almost 20 percent. West Texas Intermediate futures jumped more than 11 percent to $61.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Slower global economic growth in 2019 has seen global energy prices decline and OPEC oil output has also been on a downward trend. The full impact of the attack on Saudi oil facilities on the global oil market remains to be seen, Fu Linghui, spokesperson with the National Bureau of Statistics, said Monday at a press conference in Beijing.While it is not yet known if Chinese imports of crude oil from Saudi Arabia will be affected, but China will be able to maintain a stable oil supply for its domestic market, analysts told the Global Times.Saturday's attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities are not the first, and the country has learned to quickly recover. "The impact on the [country's] ability to export is not as great as the market has estimated," said Zhou Rong, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China."Given its past experience, it can be expected that the damaged facilities will recover in due time, which means exports to China won't be affected," Zhou told the Global Times on Monday.Declining import relianceThe drone attacks by Yemen's Houthi Group is expected to reduce Saudi Arabia's oil output by 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd), accounting for more than 5 percent of the world's oil supply, Reuters reported.The attacks are likely to cause oil prices to soar and risk interrupting global oil supplies, industry analysts said.Li Jiawei, an analyst at industry website sci99.com, said despite the disruption, Saudi Arabia will be able to maintain its normal level of exports if its facilities can be restored within three weeks.Â "It should not cause too much concern [for China] as the commodity is globally circulated and provided," Li told the Global Times on Monday, adding that Iraqi oil exports can make up any shortfall in Saudi Arabia oil exports to China, the world's largest importer of crude oil and natural gas. "Crude oil exports are not a monopoly of one country.""Many countries are eagerly waiting for opportunities to export to China, which can alleviate any supply pressure if Saudi Arabia cannot sustain its exports," said Zhou.Saudi Arabia was China's largest oil supplier before 2016, the year Russia overtook the country and has been the largest supply of crude for the last three years.China's crude imports from Saudi Arabia reached a record high of 7.72 million tons in June, up 84.1 percent year-on-year. Imports stood at 4.7 million tons in May, according to latest data released by China's customs.In March, China's oil imports from Saudi Arabia hit 7.33 million tons, or 1.7 million bpd - the highest level by then since 2004, according to from the CNPC."China's reliance on oil imports is declining gradually," said Zhou.China is nearly 80 percent reliant on crude oil imports, but is making huge efforts to diversify its supply sources, while pushing ahead the development of new energy and renewable energy sources to reduce the country's reliance on imports, according to Zhou.The stability of international oil market and crude oil price should be paid more attention to after the Saudi Arabian disruption, said Zhou.
