There are also more than 380,000 clerical personnel in China with approximately 5,500 religious groups and about 140,000 places of worship registered for religious activities, Geng noted. There is one mosque for averagely every 530 Muslims in Xinjiang, which is more than most Islamic countries, he said.In contrast to China's efforts in Xinjiang, which bring prosperity to the region, what the US has done in the past decades to innocent Muslims should be closely watched, Xu said. He used Afghanistan as an example."Does the war waged by the US bring stability and prosperity?" Xu asked. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found out that 75 percent of Muslim American adults said there is "a lot" of discrimination against Muslims in the US, a view shared by nearly seven in ten adults.The US disregards China's strong opposition and uses religion and human rights as a cover to slander China's Xinjiang policy and interferes in China's internal affairs, Geng noted. The spokesperson for the Chinese delegation to the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly said on Monday, "US attempts to take advantage of the UN platform to interfere in other countries' internal affairs violate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and run counter to the UN spirit for dialogue and cooperation, and will produce no effect whatsoever."The spokesperson added that most countries won't support the US.  "A part of the US establishment wants to confront a non-interventionist country like China and, obviously, they have to build a narrative based on universal values and principles. But it is a manufactured narrative, and another example of consent/discontent through propaganda techniques," Fabio Massimo Parenti, a professor at the International Institute Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, told the Global Times on Monday.Newspaper headline: FM slams Pence on religious freedom
