Xu told the Global Times that having a peacekeeping force in the parade shows China's responsibility as a major country in the world.Xu, 55, joined the training with younger team members and saw his weight drop from 71 to 64 kilograms. "As a team leader, I must be the benchmark for the team," he said.Wearing white berets, light blue military uniforms and white boots and holding guns, female members of the militia phalanx who come from government organizations, schools, hospitals and companies in Beijing's Chaoyang district also trained hard.When they just started training, they had weak foundations, but improved very quickly after undertaking one hour of physical exercises every day in the initial stage, said Zhu Deyou, the phalanx leader, noting that the militia phalanx can now march in a very orderly manner.

Many clothes need to be tailored into smaller sizes because parade participants have lost weight significantly since the training started.Three joint rehearsals have been successfully conducted in downtown Beijing since September, and the actual parade will be held on October 1.
