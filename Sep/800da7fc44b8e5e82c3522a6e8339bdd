Intelligence gathered by the navy, air force and ourselves on the battlefield can be reported to the command center, and shared between basic units," Liu Shuyi, staff officer of the combined arms brigade, told CCTV.Joint operations are essential in modern warfare, especially during landing missions, which are usually complicated as defenders usually have the advantage, an anonymous military expert told the Global Times on Sunday.The PLA used to conduct exercises within single military branches during which the army, navy and air force were trained on their own, the expert said, noting that joint training exercises could help the PLA make the best of its full potential.Although the report did not identify an imaginary enemy for the exercises, Chinese internet users noted the location of the exercises was close to the island of Taiwan.After the US approved a plan to sell $2.22 billion worth of tanks and missiles to the island in July, the PLA also conducted military exercises off the coast of Guangdong.The US went on to approve an $8 billion sale of fighter jets to the island in August, military analysts predicted at that time that a new round of military drills was likely to follow.
