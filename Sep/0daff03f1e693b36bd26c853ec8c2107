The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and related Security Council resolutions provide a comprehensive framework," he said."Pursuing and dismantling terrorist groups is vital, but it is just one among many measures. We must complement security measures with prevention efforts that identify and address root causes, while always respecting human rights."The UN chief called for building the resilience of societies, so that people and communities reject terrorist narratives that prey on fear and hopelessness."We must reinforce the social compact, including the provision of basic services and opportunities, particularly for young people," he said.The important role of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in countering terrorist threats is set as the focus of the debate.Guterres highlighted the need for international cooperation as the first priority of the counter-terrorist strategy."The three organizations ... are playing an important role in promoting regional counter-terrorism cooperation by facilitating the exchange of critical information and knowledge, and the implementation of joint investigations and operations," he said, adding the United Nations is strengthening its institutional links with each of them.He further said the partnership has established frameworks for joint activities, exchanges of information, and collaboration on capacity-building assistance to UN member states.In conclusion, the UN chief said the cooperation between the United Nations and the three organizations is deepening as it covers a growing range of issues. "I look forward to our continued cooperation as we work together to end the threat of terrorism and build a more secure and prosperous future for all."
