The auto industry matters both to employment and the nation's manufacturing upgrade, according to analysts.For China's auto market, which has seen sales drop year-on-year for 14 consecutive months, administrative measures like relaxing and removing purchase restrictions are necessary to promote consumption, they said.China, the world's biggest auto market, saw the first fall in vehicle sales in 20 years in 2018. Sales fell 6 percent to 22.7 million units last year, according to the China Passenger Car Association.Retail sales are expected to increase after the relaxation and removal of rules, Feng Shiming, a veteran car industry analyst based in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Major players and consumers in China's auto market have been anticipating promotion measures, but different standards are expected to be implemented by different cities based on their particular conditions of urban management, Wu Shuocheng, a Shanghai-based independent car analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.China will further tap the potential of services consumption by rolling out measures in elder care, housekeeping and baby-sitting services, according to Ning.Newspaper headline: Nation to further relax, end vehicle purchase restrictions: official
