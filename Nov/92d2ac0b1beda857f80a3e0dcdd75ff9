(Xinhua/Jaap Arriens) Huawei will launch its 5G-enabled tablet in the first quarter of 2020, which is expected to beat Samsung to become the world's first.Huawei's CEO of consumer business Yu Chengdong said on Monday during the company's launch conference focusing on its latest tablet, showing that unprecedented attention is being paid to the tablet product line.A leading company in the development and application of 5G technology, Huawei aims to maintain its competitive edge in the market by rolling out a complete series of new devices, Fu Liang, a Beijing-based telecom industry expert, told the Global Times.Apart from Huawei, South Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics is also rushing to introduce 5G devices, including tablet product Galaxy Tab S6, media reports said.However, experts said that it's hard for Samsung to beat Huawei in the 5G race."Currently, Samsung hasn't developed its own processors and still uses baseband processors provided by Qualcomm Inc. In this regard, Samsung's research and development speed is still behind that of Huawei," Xiang Ligang, a veteran industry analyst told the Global Times on Monday."Based on the available information and Huawei's readiness in the technology, the 5G tablet is expected to be released in January," Xiang said.Huawei has become the biggest tablets vendor in China, with a market share of 37.4 percent, according to Yu. Its shipment of tablets increased 24.4 percent year-on-year to about 2.1 million in the third quarter of 2019.During Monday's conference, Huawei launched a new tablet named Matepad Pro, powered by Huawei's Kirin 990 processors.The latest Matepad Pro features a 10.8-inch screen, a dual camera on the back and an attached magnetic keyboard. It also allows synchronization of content among different Huawei gadgets, enabling file transfer with USB wires or switching devices.Fu said that the latest Matepad Pro will fit more into a business scenario, and will become Huawei's next step toward a full range of 5G-enabled devices, from smartphones and tablets to watches.
