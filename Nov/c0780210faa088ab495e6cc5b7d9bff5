The module is electricity-driven with large power storage, highly integrated and compatible with different types of vessels, which can easily be installed on civilian ships.The use of civilian ships to carry out dry cargo replenishment for naval vessels is a new attempt amid the growing strength of the PLA Navy. Offshore missions in distant waters have gradually increased, making the demand for maritime logistics support increasingly prominent.China has large amounts of civilian ships on a wide range of navigation routes. Installing the replenishment module on them has great potential in strengthening marine replenishment capabilities and the military and economic benefits are remarkable.Global Times
