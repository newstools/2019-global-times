Top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un (L) and U.S. President Donald Trump leave after signing a joint statement in Singapore on June 12, 2018. (Xinhua/Ministry of Communication and Information of Singapore) North Korea is "no longer ­interested" in summits with the US unless ­Washington offers new concessions in their ­nuclear negotiations, Pyongyang said on Monday, hours after US President Donald Trump hinted at the prospect."You should act quickly, get the deal done," Trump tweeted Sunday, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. "See you soon!"Kim and Trump have met three times since June last year, but talks have been gridlocked since their Hanoi summit in February broke up in disagreement over sanctions relief, while October's working-level talks rapidly broke down in Sweden.Pyongyang has set Washington a deadline of the end of the year to come forward with a fresh offer, and North Korean Foreign Ministry Advisor Kim Kye-gwan said the US was stalling while "pretending it has made progress."He interpreted Trump's tweet as a signal for a new summit, he said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA, but declared, "We are no longer interested in such talks that bring nothing to us.""We will no longer gift the US ­president with something he can boast of," he went on, adding that North ­Korea should be compensated for the "successes" that President Trump touted as his own achievements.The implied criticism of Trump by name is a departure for Pyongyang, which has long limited its frustration to other administration officials.Last month, Kim Kye-gwan declared, "Contrary to the political judgment and intention of President Trump, Washington political circles and DPRK policy makers of the US administration are hostile to the DPRK for no reason," using the initials of North Korea's official name.In September he was fulsome in his praise for the US leader, saying that Trump was "different from his ­predecessors" and that he placed his hopes in "President Trump's wise option and bold decision." Washington should withdraw its "hostile policy" if it wants dialogue to continue, he said on Monday.Trump's tweet came after Washington and Seoul agreed to postpone annual joint aerial exercises to create space for diplomacy with Pyongyang, which condemns such drills as preparations for invasion.
