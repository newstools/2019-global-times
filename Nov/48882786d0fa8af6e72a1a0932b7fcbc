Traditional shipping by cargo boat would have taken 20 to 25 days."Once picked, they are generally processed the same day and shipped as quickly as possible to their destination markets," Bown said.Supplying China's massive market presents somewhat of a challenge for Chilean exporters, but fortunately recent anti-government protests throughout Chile have not disrupted production flows, said Bown."The current situation in Chile has touched all Chileans, certainly, and we hope it is resolved as soon as possible. (But) so far, it has not had an impact on cherry exports," he said.
