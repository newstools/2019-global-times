The artist said that walking through Beijing's many hutong (alleys) helped him travel back to his childhood when he would read The Adventures of Tintin.  "Although the writer Hergé never went to China, I had a chance to stand in the scenes from his book: bricks, Chinese characters and traditional windows," he said. The artist fell in love with China's traditional xuan paper and worked to experiment with it in his artworks. "I hope to pay tribute to China's traditions like paper, wood prints as well as how to mount a painting. Additionally, I also want to give up past habits and try something new," he said. The exhibition is scheduled to run until November 17.
