Our calculation points to an A-share weighting of 16.6 percent in MSCI Emerging Markets if the inclusion factor reaches 100 percent," said UBS.Li Daxiao, chief economist with Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities, told the Global Times Tuesday it is likely the index provider will accelerate raising A shares' inclusion next year based on the success of this year's three-step action plan."MSCI needs to maintain its advantages in racing with other index providers," said Li.Apart from MSCI, major global benchmarks FTSE Russell and the S&P Dow Jones Indices have strengthened the weighting of China's A shares or included the A-shares into their indices.In October, MSCI took China's science and technology innovation board into consideration, providing further eligibility assessment before November's semi-annual index review.This year, China introduced new measures aimed at increasing financial market reform and opening up to attract international investors.In September, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange announced it would remove the caps on two cross-border investment programs, Qualified Foreign Financial Institutional Investor (QFII) and its yuan-denominated sibling RQFII, making it more convenient for overseas investors to participate in the domestic financial market.The Chinese mainland equity market has attracted more than 240 billion yuan ($34 billion) in overseas capital since the beginning of 2019, indicating strong global investor confidence, said Li Chao, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
