Just as an oil tanker steaming ahead at full speed cannot stop immediately, so the dramatic rise in sea levels will continue even if the world manages to slash greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2030, experts warned in a study published on Monday.

The lake, with an average elevation of 4,099 meters, is a major inland lake in the upper reaches of the Qaidam River and also an important habitat for wildlife. The river channels formed by the melting of snow and ice in the mountains creates spectacular scenes.

It is still unclear why Antarctic ice is melting more slowly than in Greenland.  "When you're looking into the sea level rise problem, it's a very slow and responding system," said Nauels."A centimeter doesn't sound like much but it's actually a lot," he added.In a report published last year, experts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said reducing the rise in sea level by 10 centimeters would save 10 million people in coastal areas from being exposed to flooding, storm surges and other risks. Coastal areas currently home to 300 million people will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change, no matter how aggressively humanity curbs carbon emissions, scientists have warned.In the second half of the 21st century and beyond, however, choices made today will determine whether the global coastlines on maps today will remain recognizable to future generations, they reported in the journal Nature Communications.   Destructive storm surges fuelled by increasingly powerful cyclones and rising seas will hit Asia hardest, according to the study.More than two-thirds of the populations at risk are in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand.Newspaper headline: Sea level rise now irreversible
