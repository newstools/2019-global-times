Illustrations: Peter C. Espina/GTChinese-Canadian actor Godfrey Gao's sudden death during the filming of a reality show has shocked his fans and triggered a debate on the suitability of television programs that imperil the lives of participants. Gao, 35, who was born in the island of Taiwan, died in the wee hours of Wednesday, while participating in the filming of a TV show which involves celebrities competing to undertake physically demanding tasks. Besides expressing heartfelt condolences, many netizens blasted the program for its "inhuman" setting. Many of the games on the show are too arduous for celebrities, for example, running two kilometers at one go and climbing a 70-meter-high building. Even professional athletes such as famous Chinese boxer Zou Shiming, who earlier participated in the show, found the tasks too tough. "Do you realize that the games are not at all suitable for ordinary people? Can you afford this consequence?" "What on earth is the meaning of the show?" comments read. The tragedy should be a reminder for many TV shows: No one should put the health and lives of participants at risk to gain audiences. Audiences will not buy it.Â
