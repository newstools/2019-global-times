Job seekers view employment information during a job fair in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, Nov. 18, 2019. A job fair held on Monday attracted about 205 employers providing over 3,500 job posts. (Xinhua/Jigme Dorje) New employment statistics for Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region show that the central government's efforts to support the region's development have been successful, and this will greatly boost students' confidence, an analyst said on Thursday.As of November, 22,255 recent college graduates had signed job contracts, and the employment rate of new graduates hit 95.02 percent, nine percentage points higher than the same time last year, the People's Daily reported on Wednesday."This figure is very surprising to me, and it is impressive. It means the central government's policies and measures supporting the region's development are successful," Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times.Tibet's regional government has announced policies and measures to ensure a high employment rate. These steps included subsidies for living and housing expenses, tuition and student loans, the report said."Even though the trade war has not had a huge negative impact on Tibet, the development of the region - which has been relatively left behind - is slowing amid the broader economic environment, so the central government has taken strong measures to support Tibet," Tian said.So far this year, the region has created more than 620,000 jobs specifically for new graduates, the report said, adding that jobs created by public institutions and state-owned enterprises from the east of China exceeded 17,500."The number of jobs created by public institutions and companies accounts for a big part of the total, and it shows the central government's efforts to support the region," Tian said.
