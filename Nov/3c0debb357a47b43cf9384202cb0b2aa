The company, whose name translates as Beijing Huawei Digital Technology Co is wholly owned by Huawei.It could be a signal of Ren stepping down from senior positions of the technology giant. "The alteration in the subsidiary's board members is only an internal adjustment," Xiang Ligang, a veteran industry analyst, told the Global Times, noting that it won't have any essential impact on Huawei.It might just be a regular change of board members that amounts to an internal reshuffle, a person close to Huawei told the Global Times.Huawei has developed a mature CEO rotation management model, which enables divisions of the company to operate in a relatively independent manner while still cooperating with each other, said Liu Dingding, an independent analyst in the internet sector.Moreover, Huawei has a development strategy based on R&D, which also helps reduce the impact of changes at the senior executive level, Liu told the Global Times.
