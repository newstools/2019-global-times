Soriano is using its advanced technologies for its agricultural production and hosting corresponding forums from time to time. Soriano is also a tourist destination with beautiful landscapes, the Uruguayan Ambassador to China Fernando Lugris said in his opening speech at the event. This was Bascou's third visit to China and he expressed his hope for strengthening trade and investment with China. "Although Uruguay is a country with mere population of 3.5 million, we have the capability to produce goods and services for over 30 million people," Bascou said. "During my previous visit to China, I had initially contacted with Jilin and Shandong provinces, and this time, together with our entrepreneurs, we had a visit to these provinces in China." The governor also attended the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in early November and said that he was amazed by the scale and capacity of the expo.
