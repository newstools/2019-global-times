China upholds multilateral trade and constantly improves its business environment by seeking technological innovation," said Ye.Chinese officials said at the CIIE that the nation will uphold the multilateral trading system and promote the construction of an open world economy. In the current world economic landscape, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, and economic globalization is encountering setbacks. The authority and effectiveness of the multilateral trading system are being challenged. The cutting-edge blockchain technology has been applied to a number of business areas involved in Shanghai's international trade. These areas include digital insurance, the digital supply chain, the Internet of Things and intelligent manufacturing, said Shen Weihua, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce. According to Shen, Shanghai utilized blockchain technology for the new cross-border yuan trade financing services for the city's single window system. This application has helped solve information asymmetry during trade financing. Shanghai is only one example of blockchain application for finance in China. At the end of October, a cross-border financial blockchain service platform began trials in Nanning, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.Qi Hong, vice director of China Construction Bank's Shanghai branch, told the Global Times that the application of blockchain in finance is still at the trial stage in China."We now use blockchain in one-off products instead of the whole finance industry chain, and the public doesn't have a sound understanding of the technology when it comes to financing. But I think the government's call for blockchain construction will help push the technology's application in a more comprehensive way." She also said that China Construction Bank will continue to use blockchain to enhance its management and reduce costs.
