Information systems will be integrated to reduce human errors, said the guideline.Wan Zhe, chief economist with the International Cooperation Center of China's National Development and Reform Commission, said robust audit systems are the essence of modern corporate governance.Yuan Fuhua, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that strengthening internal controls of central SOEs is especially critical at a time when the nation is seeking a balance in curbing inflation and maintaining growth momentum.The key to curbing inflation is to control asset prices and growth that depends on debts, Yuan said, adding that as the dominant players in key areas like infrastructure, energy and finance, major SOEs are the key "safety valves" for national economy.
