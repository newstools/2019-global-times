He is irreplaceable."James wrote several novels and poetry books and received the Philip Hodgins Memorial Medal, a major Australian literature award, in 2003.He published several volumes of his memoirs, including The Blaze of Obscurity about his years in television.After an unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek in February this year, James set about compiling an autobiographical anthology of poems called The Fire Of Joy, which was finished a month ago.During his long illness, James penned his own obituary, regularly updating it on his website.He said it would "serve as a cheaper obituary than anything most newspapers are likely to have in the freezer.""I will keep updating it until they carry me to the slab, during which journey I will try to give details of my final medication," he wrote.Jonathan Miller dies, 85James' death was announced after the family of theater director Jonathan Miller said he died on Wednesday at the age of 85.Miller once appeared as a guest on James' chat show The Late Clive James in 1988, in which he discussed his love of stationery.The polymath first found fame in the early 1960s in the revue Beyond The Fringe with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.Miller directed theater and television plays, including The Merchant Of Venice at the National Theatre and six of BBC television's Shakespeare plays. "Our father died this morning peacefully at home with his family around him following a long battle with Alzheimer's," Miller's family said in a statement.Britain's National Theatre called Miller a "legendary figure across theater and opera," while the English National Opera said "his contribution to comedy, theater and ENO in particular was immeasurable."For over four decades Jonathan created some of ENO's most celebrated and popular opera productions."Newspaper headline: ‘Irreplaceable’
