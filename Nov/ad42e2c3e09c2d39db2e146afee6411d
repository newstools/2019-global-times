Tmall.com, an online retailing platform of Alibaba, China's leading e-commerce enterprise, held a promotion day on November 11, 2009, which has become a fixed date for the platform's large-scale promotions.On Monday morning, Alibaba made a new record by raking in a 10 billion yuan ($1.43 billion) in sales 96 seconds after the shopping festival kicked off, faster than the 125 seconds in 2018.The latest report by Alibaba on Monday shows that the amount of Chinese manufacturers that participated in this year's Singles' Day festival is five times more than that in 2018, and the variety of goods sold on the platform increased by a factor of 325 compared with last year.A global shopping festivalThe Singles' Day shopping festival has gone global over the past two years with an increasing number of foreign consumers and e-commerce platforms participating in the shopping festival.Boylan first joined the Singles' Day shopping frenzy in 2017 to buy Christmas gifts for his family and friends after a friend introduced him to the Chinese online retailing website.The 21-year-old post-graduate loves cooking, and has bought many sorts of kitchenware from knives to electronics from China via the  retailing website."It has better prices than Amazon and is much more reliable than Ebay," Boylan told the Global Times. Boylan prepared a long shopping list for the shopping festival since then.

"I've spent hours at a time browsing online, looking for the right things."A report by Alibaba.com, a business-to-business e-commerce platform under Alibaba Group, shows that foreign consumers have a special preference for some "strange" items.According to the report, sales of weighted blankets to markets abroad have seen a 98 percent year-on-year growth in 2019, despite some doubt over the blanket's stress easing function.Tan Zhe, a manager of Shaoxing Dotex Textile Co Ltd, a weighted blanket manufacturer based in East China's Zhejiang Province, told the Global Times he received first overseas order for weighted blanket on May from the US, and used an additional 30 percent of manpower to guarantee the order's shipment before the shopping festival.Tan said more than 90 percent of their foreign orders are from the US, adding that usually orders for Singles' Day would come in during August and September, 60 to 70 percent more than order numbers in other months.

 Alibaba.com has supported more than 8 million foreign small and micro entrepreneurs and more than 1 million online retail dealers, and they are the major group targeted by Alibaba.com during this year's Singles' Day shopping festival.In addition to weighted blankets, T-Rex dresses, hairpieces, massage guns, and a fascia massage device initially popular among NBA players also saw remarkable growth.According to data released by Alibaba.com, Germans are considering buying motorcycles from Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, and African countries have high demand for excavators made in Changsha in Central China's Hunan Province. Other daily merchandise such as earphones, cell phone holders and foldable electric bicycles are popular among foreign consumers,too.On November 4, a warm-up promotion day before the Singles' Day shopping festival, Alibaba.com saw a 106 percent year-on-year gross merchandise volume increase, and a 130 percent increase in terms of the number of consumers.Empowered by easy paymentEasy payment also expands the reach of the shopping festival to go abroad, as Alipay, a leading Chinese mobile payment affiliated to Alibaba Group, announced on November 8 that the platform will support consumers in 11 Asian countries including Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan to participate in the Singles' Day shopping festival through its subsidiaries, Tmall.com and Alipay, Chinanews.com reported.Alibaba.com upgraded its payment system, supporting payment via 22 different currencies in 56 countries, while foreign exchange cost dropped from 2 to 3 percent to 1 percent.

The company has set warehouses in such cities as Shanghai, Yiwu of East China's Zhejiang Province and Qingdao, a coastal city of East China's Shandong Province. The special routes allow goods to be delivered globally within two to five work days.Cainiao, a logistic unit of Alibaba, took a pledge to guarantee package delivery during the shopping frenzy in a fast and high-quality manner. The slogan "Together, we can create another new record of global logistic" has been printed on airplanes, ships, trains, cargos, warehouses and package lockers across countries in China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and many countries in Europe, North America and Southeast Asia, according to a report by China News Agency on Saturday.
