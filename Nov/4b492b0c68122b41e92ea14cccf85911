The security check won't finish in time for you to see the parade," one policeman with a loudspeaker warned those still in line.Yoko Mori, 64, lined up from 10 am to secure a spot, traveling from Saitama outside Tokyo."We came here because it's a once in a lifetime opportunity and we wanted to celebrate this event," she told AFP, flanked by her friend Chiyoe Ito, 70.After the national anthem was played, the royal couple boarded a specially made car featuring the chrysanthemum imperial logo on the sides and the royal flag on its bonnet.The parade of nearly five kilometers through central Tokyo was originally scheduled for October 22, but the government postponed it after more than 80 people were killed by Typhoon Hagibis last month.Naruhito officially ascended the throne earlier this year, with an elaborate and ritual-bound ceremony last month proclaiming his rise before dignitaries from around the world.
