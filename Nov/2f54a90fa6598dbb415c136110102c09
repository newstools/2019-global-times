An ancient tomb dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907) was found in North China's Hebei Province, according to the local cultural relics protection department on Monday.The tomb, which experts believe dates back more than 1,200 years, was discovered by a villager when digging in Duanying village in Cixian county.A tombstone, two porcelains, 12 pottery vessels and some bronze pieces were also unearthed.The inscription on the square-shaped tombstone consists of 323 Chinese characters and records the name, birthplace and life story of the tomb's owner. The tomb owner was believed to be a respectable man, said Zhao Xuefeng, a cultural relics expert, adding that the findings can serve as a reference for research on funeral customs and the history of the village.The two porcelains, one a bluish-white glazed tripod censer and the other a black glazed jar with two loop handles, are important material for research into the porcelain craftsmanship of the Cizhou Kiln and its shift from using celadon glaze to white glaze, Zhao said.
