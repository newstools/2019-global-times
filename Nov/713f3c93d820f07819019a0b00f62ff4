Photo: VCGA nightclub in East China's Jiangxi Province which displayed a plastic model featuring the lower parts of a female body at its arched door has sparked anger among Chinese netizens, who criticized the club for degrading women and failing to meet the bottom line of law and morality. According to photos circulated online, a plastic model featuring two female bare legs with rosy high-heeled shoes was displayed outside the nightclub in Ningdu.
