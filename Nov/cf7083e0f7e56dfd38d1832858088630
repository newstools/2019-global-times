The accident brings to 38 the number of French soldiers killed in Mali since the intervention began.France has around 4,500 troops in the country as part of its Barkhane operation, which is primarily tasked with building up and training local security forces but also participates in operations against the insurgents.An inquiry has been opened into the cause of the midair collision, French ­Defense Minister Florence Parly said in a separate statement.Defense ministry sources said a Tiger attack helicopter collided with a larger Cougar military transport helicopter.It was the heaviest loss for the French army since the 1983 attack on the Drakkar building in Beirut, Lebanon in which 58 paratroopers were killed.Mali has sustained a wave of insurgency strikes on army outposts and ­other targets, with more than 50 killed over just a few days in early November.It is one of the countries in the Sahel region of Africa that has been caught in the eye of the jihadist storm since 2012, along with Niger, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad.
