Photo: VCGChina's biggest ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing is being accused of "imposing a curfew on female users" after it announced a trial relaunch of Didi Hitch on Wednesday, more than a year after the company suspended the service following the murders of two female passengers by their Didi drivers.The Didi Hitch trial service, which will begin November, is being offered to women between 5 am and 8 pm, while men can use the service from 5 am to 11 pm, according to Didi Chuxing's official website on Wednesday. Didi Hitch is a lower-cost service that links drivers and passengers heading in the same direction. Didi's regular car hailing service remains available to all, all the time.The new rules for Didi Hitch triggered criticism on China's social media, with many calling the rules sexist. "This isn't fair to female passengers who work night shift and need a ride after 8 pm," wrote a netizen in a post that had a lot of thumbs up. Others wrote that women should be respected, not restricted.Netizens suggested that instead of simply "imposing a curfew" on women for safety, the company should arrange for female drivers to pick up female passengers after 8 pm.Other netizens noted that one of the murders last year occurred at 1:30 pm.Some netizens supported Didi, saying that the company is trying to protect the safety of its female passengers."Which is more important, convenience or safety, and why can't they think of a good way to have both?"Didi responded to netizens' questions on Wednesday and said the company appreciates the advice and criticism. "Didi is also piloting a women's safety program with Hitch," the company said.Key features of the program include enhanced risk analysis, alert and intervention models that identify high-risk scenarios and trip anomalies, and effective intervention, according to Didi.The program also includes "a new in-app Safety Assistant that shows more detailed information on drivers and passengers, and offers real-time support from safety specialists."Didi stressed that the current rules are for trial operation, and the official launch of Hitch will be improved based on customer feedback.The trial relaunch of Hitch will be conducted in seven major Chinese cities including Beijing, Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, Taiyuan, North China's Shanxi Province, Shijiazhuang, North China's Hebei Province, Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning Province, Changzhou and Nantong, East China's Jiangsu Province.Newspaper headline: ‘Sexist’ Didi Hitch accused of being unfair to female passengers
