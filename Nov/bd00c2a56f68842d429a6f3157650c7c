People dance outside the Xinjiang International Grand Bazaar in Urumqi, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, May 22, 2019. Photo: XinhuaSome media are using  despicable methods to hype domestic affairs in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and smear China's efforts on anti-terrorism and de-radicalization, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said on Monday, in response to reports on another batch of so-called leaked documents published by some Western media. BBC reported on Sunday night that it got "official" documents which detail China's "brainwashing" of Muslims in Xinjiang. It said the leak was made to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which has worked with 17 media partners, including BBC Panorama and The Guardian newspaper in the UK."Last week, I made response to the The New York Times hyping a so-called 'internal document.' I want to reiterate here that Xinjiang affairs are China's domestic affairs. Some media use despicable methods to hype Xinjiang issues and their attempt to smear Xinjiang's efforts on anti-terrorism and de-radicalization will not succeed," Geng said.Xinjiang's stability, the unity of different ethnic groups and a harmonious society are the best response to these rumors, Geng said. On November 18, the Xinjiang regional government refuted The New York Times' report on the so-called leaked "internal document." It said the media's report is news fabricated by anti-China forces at home and abroad with evil intentions.
