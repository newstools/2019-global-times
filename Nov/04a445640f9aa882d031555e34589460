Greek civilization is like a root of Western civilizations, and if we can find shared values and ideas in Chinese and Greek civilizations and even realize high-level mutual trust and cooperation, we may find the key to solving the clash of civilizations between the East and the West," he said.Chinese experts noted that cooperation between China and Greece could be a successful example for the relationship between Western and Eastern countries.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who visited Shanghai and attended the China International Import Expo (CIIE) 2019, also met Xi in Athens on Monday."My recent visit to Shanghai and yours today have inaugurated a new era in our relations. Greece recognizes China as a great country and you should be proud of what you have achieved," he said on Monday, the Athens-Macedonia News Agency reported. The Bank of China will open up a branch in Athens in November, while the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) will open up a representative office soon after. The Chinese online platform Alibaba, with its 700-million-strong customer base, will also include Greek products on its site, Greek news website greekreporter.com reported.Li said with the development of Piraeus port, not only the port operator China COSCO Shipping, but also many Chinese firms that have trade ties with Greece will need financial services, so the financial move is signaling the cooperation and mutual trust between the two countries has reached a new height.Konstantinos Ntasios, sales director of international markets with Hellenic Dairies SA, a Greek company that participated in CIIE 2019, said that "the relationship between China and Greece is at the best level ever."There are great Chinese investments in Greece. And there are Greek opportunities through tourism, shipping, food, agricultural trade, products trade in the Chinese market. I believe that the relationship can become stronger, because their people respect each other," Ntasios said. Newspaper headline: Xi meets Greek President
