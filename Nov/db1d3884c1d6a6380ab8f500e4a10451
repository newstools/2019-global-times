Many of which continue to fly with at least one unmodified engine.Meanwhile IndiGo said it would meet the deadline set by the regulator."IndiGo is working with PW and Airbus to adjust inflow of LPT 3 modified engines to meet the DGCA guidelines," local media have quoted IndiGo spokesperson as saying.Earlier on Nov. 1, the DGCA had directed IndiGo to replace P&W engines with modified LPTs (low pressure turbines) on 97 Airbus A320Neo aircraft by Jan. 31, 2020, following a series of engine incidents.
