GV971 is the first such drug approved globally in 17 years.Rao said in the letter that "it is impossible that the paper is not faked," without providing evidence.However, China News Week reported late Friday that Rao said the letter "was only a draft, and not published," without giving further details.Dingxiangyuan also deleted the widely shared post late Friday.The Beijing News reported that the National Natural Science Foundation of China is investigating into the matter.It's the first novel drug approved for treating AD patients since 2003, media reported. Forest Labs' Namenda was approved in the US that year.
