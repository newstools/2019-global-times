The show features digital paintings, oil paintings and prints created by the artist since 2011.The highlight comes from the artist's titular giant painting Light of Love. The painting, which is 15 meters in length and three meters in height, features the young girl Sa Mi, which means "beautiful girl" in the Beijing dialect. According to the exhibition's curator Wang Boqiao, it is rare to see such a large-sized painting from the artist. Her last such work was created in 2014 for a museum in Japan's Fukuoka Prefecture. Many of her works are unforgettable memories for art lovers born in the 1970s and 1980s, especially the image of Sa Mi. In the preface to the exhibition, the artist said that she hopes the artworks on display will inspire everyone to reflect on themselves and look back on their lives. The exhibition is scheduled to run until December 20.
