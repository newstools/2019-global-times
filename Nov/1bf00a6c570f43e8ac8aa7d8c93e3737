A rail line entered operation in east China's Shandong Province Tuesday, bringing Yimeng mountains, an old revolutionary base, into the country's fast-developing high-speed rail network for the first time. The newly launched section, which links Rizhao and Qufu, both in Shandong, stretches 235 km with a designed speed of 350 km per hour, slashing the travel time between the two cities to 1 hour 14 minutes from the current 3 hours 13 minutes.
