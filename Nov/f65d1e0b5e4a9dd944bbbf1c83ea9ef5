He also noted in Bangkok that Hong Kong, as a financial center, has played a pivotal role in the BRI.With sufficient senior professionals, Hong Kong could offer various professional services, including project financing, Yau said.The major advantage of Hong Kong with regard to cooperation in the BRI is its financial sector, Li Wei, a professor of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday.Since capital from the Chinese mainland is facing restrictions when investing overseas, Hong Kong could offer a much easier approach for BRI projects' financing, Li noted.To expand economic cooperation with Southeast Asian countries under the framework of the BRI is both in line with the long-term economic growth of Hong Kong, and also could ease Hong Kong's short-term pressure amid a technical recession, said Liu Guohong, director of the Department of Finance and Modern Industries at the China Development Institute in Shenzhen.Hong Kong's third-quarter GDP fell 2.9 percent year-on-year, data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority showed
