Tmall has since said it is investigating the apparent con and will deal with the refund issues. Some netizens doubted Tmall wasn't taking the case seriously. "Maybe Tmall should launch a fraud investigation since the seller likely collected nearly 300,000 yuan from customers," said a Weibo user. Global Times
