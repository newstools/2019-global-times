Huawei gear was originally expected to be used but eventually the project chose devices from US-based Fortinet and Cisco.Countries in central Europe have been facing pressure from the US in their local 5G deployment as regard Huawei. Earlier this year, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to persuade countries in the region including Hungary, Slovakia and Poland that allowing Huawei to deploy equipment would make it hard for the US to "partner alongside them." In September, Poland signed an agreement with the US that will bring in tougher evaluation of 5G network providers for signs of foreign control.Huawei has not been officially excluded from Slovakia's 5G deployment and the country's Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said in January that the country does not consider Huawei as a security threat. "We understand that the current issue with Huawei due to allegations can be cumbersome on the global stage," Raši told the Global Times, but added that Slovakia is hoping the cybersecurity certification system developed by the EU will limit its concerns.
