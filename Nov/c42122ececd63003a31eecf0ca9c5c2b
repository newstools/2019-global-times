Kim agreed with Chen and said he hopes the two sides will expand cooperation in agriculture, healthcare and tourism.The delegation witnessed the signing of an agreement on the prevention and control of infectious diseases between Dandong, Liaoning Province and Sinuiju, North Pyongan Province.The delegation also visited former North Korea leader Kim Il-sung's former residence, Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies, a cosmetics factory and a kindergarten in Sinuiju.Top level exchanges have been frequent in the recent years. Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a two-day state visit to North Korea in June. In 2018, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un paid three visits to China in three months. "In addition to top level mutual visits, provincial exchanges are a new highlight in China-North Korea relations," Da Zhigang, director and research fellow of Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday."The visit not only supports North Korea in its economic construction and opening-up, but will also help revitalize Northeast China," Da said.Although the UN has not completely lifted sanctions on North Korea, China and North Korea can cooperate in certain sectors including culture, tourism and other areas that are not included in the sanctions, Da said.Cooperating with China "can improve North Korea's economic dynamics, give the country real benefits and help promote the overall economic cooperation in Northeast Asia," he said.
