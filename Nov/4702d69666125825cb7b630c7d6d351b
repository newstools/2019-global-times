Only a few days ago, a court in Beijing identified Wang Sicong as a debtor owing over 150 million yuan ($21.44 million).In a surprising move that has generated fierce contentions, all posts from his 44 million following Sina Weibo account were deleted in early November. His Weibo account remains emptied as of Saturday.Many net users, still impressed with photos he posted in the past flaunting his pampered Alaska pooch, named Wang Keke, wearing two fancy Apple watches on its legs, lamented on the social media on how unlucky the year of 2019 has fared for Wang Sicong.Meanwhile, his father, Wang Jianlin, slipped to the 14th on the Forbes China Rich List in 2019. Wang Jianlin, the former richest man in China, saw his fortune downsizing to $12.5 billion from $22.7 billion in 2018.Â Global Times Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Youth climate strikeAntique cars highlighted in US auto showsWildfire aftermath
