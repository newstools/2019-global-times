Photo: Hong Kong-based online news portal HK01China's State Council on Tuesday appointed Tang Ping-keung as Commissioner of Police of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), replacing Lo Wai-chung, as experts and retired senior police officers noted that Tang could be more decisive and tougher in helping stop violence and chaos in the city.The decision was made in accordance with the HKSAR Basic Law, and based on the nomination and suggestion of HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Xinhua reported on Tuesday. At Tuesday's press conference held at Hong Kong Police Headquarters in Wan Chai, Tang, who is a 30-year veteran of the force, said it is an honor to be appointed commissioner, but he is saddened by the unrest over the past five months caused by rioters who have set fire, barricaded roads and assaulted Hong Kong residents, visitors and police.Hong Kong media reported that Tang is considered more hawkish than his predecessor, suggesting he might take tougher measures to quell the unrest and help restore order. Experts noted that this decision on the new police chief shows the central government and the HKSAR government hopes the police's law-enforcement could be more effective and decisive.Hong Kong Junior Police Officers' Association Chairman Lam Chi-wai told the Global Times that Tang is a decisive man with strong determination and a very clear mind, and the Hong Kong Police Force in the next stage needs to unite more people from different fields to make joint efforts to stop violence and chaos for the city."Stopping violence and chaos cannot only rely on the police," Lam Chi-wai said.Joe Chan Cho-kwong, Consultant of JPOA of Hong Kong and a retired senior police officer, told the Global Times that "Tang has a good reputation among us, and he is a leader with very high efficiency. I've known him since the Occupy Central incident in 2014, and he also did a good job in dealing with the 2016 Mong Kok riot."Tang is a very decisive commander and takes more straightforward tactical action in dealing with rioters who have occupied and created chaos at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Chan said, noting that "we can see Tang's leadership has already started to change the style of police law-enforcement. This could be more effective in stopping violence and chaos in the entire city."Tang said at the press conference that he will take up his new responsibilities in the coming days and will continue to protect all police officers, crack down on rioters' violent crimes and restore social order as soon as possible.Vowing more support for police, Tang said that while some offenders have been dissatisfied with police operations, most Hong Kong residents stand by their police force. Tang also claimed that there are many fake news and false charges against the police on the internet, police will clarify rumors through different channels including press conferences, on social media, and communicating with all walks of life to minimize misunderstandings, the Hong Kong media reported. Lam said Tang has served as a Hong Kong police officer for more than 30 years and has extensive experience in criminal investigations, international liaison and operational command, China Central Television reported her as saying on Tuesday. Chan said the Hong Kong Police will have greater resolve and confidence in stopping violence and chaos, as long as the HKSAR government gives unshakeable trust and support to the police.Tang joined the police force in 1987, and promoted to Deputy Commissioner of Police of HKSAR in November 2018. He has received many awards including the Police Distinguished Service Medals (PDSM), the force's top award in 2018, reported Hong Kong media.
