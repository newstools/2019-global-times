After the adjustment, A-shares will have weights of 12.1 percent and 4.1 percent in the MSCI China and MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes, and more than $31.5 billion in investment is expected to invest in Chinese stocks, domestic news site thepaper.cn reported.The increasing weightings in the MSCI indexes is but a small example of the growing enthusiasm of international investors. In the next decade, China's A-share market is expected to pull in as much as 5 trillion yuan as the financial system continues to open up, Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund Management Co, told the Global Times on Sunday. "With the scrapping of quota limits for foreign institutional investors in the market, and the opening of the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, obstacles have been removed for overseas capital to enter the financial system in China's mainland," Yang said. Following the success of the Shanghai-London Stock Connect, the China Europe International Exchange is also advancing the process of establishing a Shanghai-Frankfurt Stock Connect, a link between China's and Germany's stock markets to facilitate more investment."With the unique Chinese depositary receipt listings of German blue-chips in Shanghai, we see great opportunity to further facilitate the two-way opening up of the Chinese capital markets and to bring the European and the Chinese markets closer together," according to CEINEX's statement to the Global Times.
