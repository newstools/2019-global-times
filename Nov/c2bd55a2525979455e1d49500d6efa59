It is also in serious violation of the international law and basic norms governing international relations. It is a gross hegemonic move, Le said, noting that the Chinese government and the people express strong indignation and firm opposition against it.Hong Kong is part of China and Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs, brooking no interference from any foreign government or force, he said.The Chinese government has unswerving determination to defend national sovereignty, security and development interests, implement "one country, two systems" principle and oppose any external force in interfering in Hong Kong affairs, Le stressed.
