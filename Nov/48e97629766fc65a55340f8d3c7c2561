This translated to a 521 billion yen contribution to Japan's economy, with a further 225 billion yen contribution coming from employment at Huawei itself and indirectly from its supply chain.Huawei has been seeking suppliers from China and abroad since the US ban in May, and Japan is just one of its "targets," Fu Liang, a Beijing-based telecom industry expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday.While Fu said that although Japan has the strength and ability to "replace" some of Huawei's US suppliers amid the ongoing China-US trade war, "Huawei should not count too much on Japan as the country could also face pressure from the US."In the longer term, US technology companies would be only the victims as the US ban is indeed forcing Huawei to support their competitors around the world and curb their advantages, Fu said.
