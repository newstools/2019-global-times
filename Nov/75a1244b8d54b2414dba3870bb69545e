The rain season usually kicks off from around the middle of November."We want to avoid a situation where we trans-locate animals, only for them to starve to death because there is no food in their new habitat," he explained.The relocation was announced after the death of dozens of elephants in Hwange, Zimbabwe's biggest game reserve, located in the northwest of the country.Hungry elephants have been breaking out of wildlife areas and raiding human settlements in search for food, posing a threat to communities.
