They held HKUST president captive for six hours, while falsely accusing a Chinese mainland teacher of sexual harassment.On Wednesday, a Chinese mainland student accused of shoving a protester was beaten by rioters. When security guards tried to protect him, protesters struck the student's head and attacked him with umbrellas.
