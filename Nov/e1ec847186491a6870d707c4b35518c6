The previous record high was 58 percent in the 2016 Legislative Council elections.A large number of voters not only selected their preferred candidate to sit on the district council but also voted to express their view on many social issues, the chief executive said.  The result reflects dissatisfaction with the HKSAR government, Lam said.Lam said during the press conference on Tuesday that she has not received any instructions from the central government on who will be held accountable for the election results.Lam condemned the violence saying no one should resort to violence, which will not solve problems and only hurt Hong Kong.Global Times
