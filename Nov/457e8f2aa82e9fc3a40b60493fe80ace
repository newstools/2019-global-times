Netizens said that the biggest name is Oscar-winning director Ang Lee, this year's festival chair, who admitted in an interview with Taiwan media this year that he feels a little nervous as it is different from previous ones.The awards also lost a number of sponsorships, including Maserati, Bulgari and OPPO, after the mainland side decided to boycott the festival.The Golden Horse festival has fallen far below people's expectations, and the political atmosphere on the island will definitely have an impact on the film festival's future, said Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Beijing Union University. Wang Jianmin, a research fellow from the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the Golden Horse Awards was once an influential stage for cultural exchanges between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits and all Chinese-speaking regions, however, its fall is inevitable, noting that last year's political comments polluted the award, which turned into a stage to promote Taiwan secessionism.Last year, Taiwan filmmaker Fu Yu expressed her support for the "independence of Taiwan" in her acceptance speech for her award-winning documentary Our Youth in Taiwan, which tells the story of the anti-reunification Sunflower Student Movement. Chinese mainland actress Gong Li, the then jury chair, expressed her opposition to Yu's behavior by refusing to go on stage and present an award. In the wake of that, mainland filmmakers and actors did not attend a dinner party as a protest.In August, the China Film Administration announced a ban on Chinese mainland movies and artists from participating in this year's Golden Horse Film Festival. Some film studios and entertainers in Hong Kong also announced a same decision later.Secessionist remarks have touched the mainland's redline, whose boycott is not the only reason why the sheen is off this year's awards, Wang said, noting that development of the mainland's economy and cultural industries will get full support, let alone a potential audience of some 1.4-billion domestically. Mainland directors won four of the past five Golden Horse Awards (2014-18) for best director. The best actor of the past five years has all been awarded to mainland actors. Given the unstable political environment on the island of Taiwan, there will be more and more entertainers coming to the mainland, Wang added.Newspaper headline: Shine shifts from Horse to Rooster
