Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest rose to its highest in over a decade this year, government data on Monday showed, confirming a sharp increase under the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.

This government today is the worst enemy of the Amazon," said Marcio Astrini, public policy coordinator for Greenpeace, in a statement.Bolsonaro's office directed Reuters to remarks made by Salles and another official and did not comment further on the issue.In August, Reuters reported Bolsonaro's government had systematically weakened environmental agency Ibama, grounding a team of elite enforcement commandos and forbidding agents from destroying machinery used to illegally deforest.Brazil's Climate Observatory, a network of nongovernmental organizations, said the 2019 increase in deforestation was the fastest in percentage terms since the 1990s and the third fastest of all-time.In response to the numbers, Salles vowed to roll out a series of measures to counter the rising deforestation, including stepping up enforcement efforts assisted by high-resolution satellite imaging.The minister said he would meet governors of Amazon states on Wednesday to discuss tactics to counter deforestation.All options are on the table, according to Salles, including mobilizing the military for use in environmental enforcement operations.Newspaper headline: Brazil deforestation at 11-year high
