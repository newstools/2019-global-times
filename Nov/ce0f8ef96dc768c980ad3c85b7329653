They flew 380 kilometers and reached a maximum altitude of 97 kilometers, the JCS added.Nuclear negotiations between the US and North Korea have been at a standstill since the Hanoi summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un broke up in February, and Pyongyang has since demanded Washington change its approach by the end of the year.Last month Pyongyang also claimed to have tested a "new type" of submarine-launched ballistic missile - a potential strategic game changer.Trump has played down the recent launches, repeatedly pointing to North Korea's moratorium on nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches as foreign policy successes for him.Trump and Kim adopted a vaguely worded statement on the "complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" at their first summit in Singapore in June 2018, but little progress has since been made.North Korea is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs and lifting some of them was a key demand in Hanoi.In June Trump and Kim agreed to restart working-level talks during a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone dividing the peninsula and the two sides met in Sweden in October, only for Pyongyang to walk away.Earlier this month, Seoul and Washington said they would postpone planned joint military exercises to ease diplomacy with North Korea, an announcement Pyongyang dismissed.
