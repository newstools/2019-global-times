Rather, it is a long-arm jurisdiction move based on US hegemony."What the US politicians want is to keep the fire burning," he said.The senator has turned a blind eye to Hong Kong rioters' vandalism and violence, and brazenly endorses Hong Kong's radicals, which reveal his intention to sabotage Hong Kong's prosperity and contain China's development, Geng said.3Geng warned that if the bill becomes law, not only China's, but US interests will be damaged. China will surely take strong measures to fight back the US wrongdoing, and defend its sovereignty.
