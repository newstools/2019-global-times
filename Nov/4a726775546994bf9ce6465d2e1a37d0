(Xinhua/Wang Weiguang)(swt) Days before the 11th BRICS summit to be held here on Nov. 13-14, the Brazilian government reaffirmed its defense of multilateralism in international relations for the promotion of common and negotiated solutions to the world's problems.Brazil's position on multilateralism is "very clear," said Norberto Moretti, secretary for commercial and economic foreign policy of the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs."Brazil maintains its traditional position of not only making the strongest call for multilateralism, but also a political commitment to implementing, strengthening, and allowing for the vitality of multilateralism," Moretti said in a recent interview with Xinhua."We give daily demonstrations of this, whether supporting processes of reform in the WTO, for example, or participating diplomatically in various forums in which, with flexibility and creativity, common multilateral, plurilateral solutions are found when possible for the problems of the world, always making an effort to achieve negotiated solutions," he said.
