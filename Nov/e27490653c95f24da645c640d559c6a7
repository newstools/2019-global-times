Some 650 people have also been treated for injuries, mostly minor, according to the health ministry.The powerful quake, which struck just before 4 am (03:00 GMT) on Tuesday, was the strongest to jolt Albania in decades, according to authorities."The priority is to save people's lives," said Prime Minister Edi Rama, who declared Wednesday a national day of mourning and announced a 30-day state of emergency for Durres and Thumane.Festivities planned for Albania's Independence Day celebration on Thursday and Friday have been canceled. Thousands of people spent the night in tents or on the grass of the soccer stadium in Durres, where some 27 buildings were badly damaged.Many were afraid to return home as more than 300 aftershocks were felt in Albania and the wider region following Tuesday's quake.In neighboring Greece, a strong 6.1-magnitude underwater earthquake shook the island of Crete on Wednesday morning.Earthquakes are common in the Balkans due to the movements of two large tectonic plates - the African and Eurasian - and the smaller Adriatic micro-plate.
