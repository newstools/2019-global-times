Many carriers rely on Huawei for its high-quality, market-leading, and cost-effective equipment and services. Without access to those solutions, these carriers will lose their ability to provide reliable and high-speed telecommunications and internet services," Huawei said."Due to reduced competition in the market for telecommunications equipment, particularly in cutting-edge 5G networks, all Americans will pay higher prices for these critical services," it continued.
