According to media reports, Huawei's latest Kirin 990 5G chipset, which will power Huawei's latest 5G smartphones like the Mate 30 and the foldable Mate X, is integrated with the 7-nanometer lithography technology from TSMC. Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times that for companies in Taiwan, mainland enterprises are indispensable as they represent the largest market with the highest demand for the company's products."Stopping supplies to Huawei will pose a huge challenge to TSMC's business," Xiang said. "Huawei is currently the company's biggest client, so a prohibition in supply will mean massive amounts of overstock. That is also why companies like TSMC have repeatedly voiced support for Huawei."TSMC has denied allegations that it will be blocked from supplying Huawei, and stated that it will continue to supply the company and comply with trade regulations, according to media reports.TSMC spokesperson Elizabeth Sun said the company had no discussion with the Taiwan authorities or the US government regarding shipping wafers to HiSilicon, the fabless semiconductor company owned by Huawei.Close cross-Straits cooperation will also accelerate 5G deployment in Taiwan, Xiang said, as Taiwan is lagging behind in 5G deployments. Participating in the mainland's deployment, and potentially allowing mainland companies into the 5G construction process in Taiwan, will lower the cost and speed up the deployment process. Taiwan will only start the auction of 5G spectrum on December 10 and the winning bidders will be awarded 5G licenses by the end of January 2020, according to local media reports. According to Chungwa Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in the island of Taiwan, 5G service in Taiwan is expected to start in July next year.5G research and development is also highlighted in the "26 measures" introduced by the mainland on November 4, the latest measure to accelerate integrated cross-Straits development.
