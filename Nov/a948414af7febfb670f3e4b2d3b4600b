The ship's transit through the Taiwan Straits demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific," said Commodore Reann Mommsen, spokesperson for the US 7th fleet.Using the so-called freedom of navigation in the region is only an excuse to allow the US military presence in the Straits, Song noted. "This can also largely encourage the secessionists in the island."To deal with this kind of provocation, the PLA should continue to strengthen its military capability, Song noted. "When US warships transit through the Taiwan Straits, the PLA should intensify its surveillance and even conduct an interception once it touches the bottom line and damages China's core interests and sovereignty," he said. A military expert at a Beijing-based PLA military academy who asked for anonymity, told the Global Times on Wednesday that no US vessel could survive an attack by PLA missiles if necessary, "so tactically we don't really worry about US military presence there."China has repeatedly said it will not hesitate to use force over the Taiwan question if necessary so the US should not support Taiwan secessionists or underestimate China's determination and resolve even if it means unimaginable military conflict between China and the US, Song noted.Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Chinese people are tired and bored of the frequent presence of US warships in the Taiwan Straits as it attempts to grab attention to gain leverage.Newspaper headline: US urged to stop provocations
