From January to October 2019, China Customs handled 444 cases of smuggling of endangered species and their products, and seized 1,238 tons of endangered species and their products.Moreover, China's efforts to crack down on the smuggling of solid waste have also made remarkable progress. Sun Zhijie, director of the anti-smuggling bureau of the General Administration of Customs, said that the number of cases on file and the amount of waste involved decreased by 23 percent and 52 percent year-on-year, respectively."China was a big importer of solid waste in the past, and as China strengthens its crackdown, solid waste has started to spread to neighboring countries instead, such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, Sun told the Global Times.China Customs will continue to strengthen supervision and crack down on smuggling, so as to face future challenges with more advanced technology, more professional measures and closer cooperation, said Ni Yuefeng, director of the General Administration of Customs, at the conference.Global Times Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Modern-day matchmakerCandlelight vigilWestern media creates illusion for human trafficking victims
