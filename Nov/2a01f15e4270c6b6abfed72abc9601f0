But the sources said the latest fundraising valued the five-year-old company, led by 42-year-old entrepreneur He Xiaopeng, at nearly $4 billion, higher than the 25 billion yuan ($3.57 billion) valuation in the last funding round.The dollar fundraising comes as XPeng, which has mostly raised yuan-denominated capital, mulls going public in the coming years, with New York among one of possible listing venues, the people said. It is also considering Hong Kong and Shanghai's NASDAQ-style sci-tech board, said one of them.With Xiaomi, XPeng will explore more applications of smartphone technologies on intelligent connected vehicles, said one of the sources."The signing of the new fundraising, which not only attracted new strategic investors such as Xiaomi Corp but also received strong support from many of our current shareholders, is a renewed endorsement of our long-term strategy," XPeng Chief Executive He said in the statement.The proceeds will be mainly used for research and development of autonomous driving-related software, mass production of its G3 sport utility vehicle model and P7 sedan, branding and expanding its retail network, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the matter was private.XPeng also secured "several billions" of yuan-dominated unsecured credit lines from banks including China Merchants Bank, China CITIC Bank and HSBC, the statement said, without specifying figures.China's new-energy vehicle (NEV) market, the world's largest, had booming growth in the recent past. But fewer NEVs could be sold in China this year than in 2018, an official at the country's biggest auto industry association warned after NEV sales dropped 46 percent in October.Numerous setbacks plaguing EV companies in their quests for sustained profitability have also put investors on their guard.XPeng, which sold about 13,000 vehicles in the first nine months of this year, also counts IDG Capital and Hillhouse Capital Group among its backers. It is one of several Chinese start-ups looking to speed up development of battery-powered technology and compete with global leaders including US' EV giant Tesla.
