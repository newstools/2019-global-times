It may sound like science fiction, but in a few short years the family dinner table may be laden with steak from a printer and other proteins produced from air, methane or volcanic microbes.

"And people are looking for hope and solutions and they're happy to see companies like ours, so that's encouraging."Fermentation, fermentation, fermentationAnother company tackling agriculture's emissions through fermentation, Bangalore-based String Bio, is working to convert methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide as it traps 28 times more heat, from waste and natural sources into protein powder - initially for animals."We said this is probably the best impact we humans can have in this world, where we take something that we don't need for the environment and convert it into something we do need," said Vinod Kumar, who with his wife Ezhil Subbian set up the company.Such environmental considerations, along with concerns over animal welfare and human health, have driven both demand and supply of alternative proteins, said Dan Altschuler Malek, managing partner at investment firm Unovis Partners.Just 10 years ago he said retailers saw alternative proteins as a risky bet, but "today they realize there is a huge demand for all these products."Unovis manages New Crop Capital, a fund that invests exclusively in start-ups developing meat, seafood and dairy replacements, including Beyond Meat.New Crop has also invested in Nova Meats, a Spanish company that uses a special 3D printer to produce steak that can mimic the taste and texture of meat.The printers produce three-dimensional vegan steaks using cartridge-style syringes which extrude plant-based proteins.

But If you cannot convert that into mass manufacturing it's really hard to see how that can actually make a change in the world."It is also an opportunity for a radical shift in agriculture which, despite incremental improvements, has remained much the same for centuries, Jonas said."Fundamentally we are surviving on this planet based on an agricultural system that has barely changed in the past 11,000 years... when we domesticated a handful of plants and animals.""New technologies are really giving us tools for a second domestication - things that we didn't even know were there."Newspaper headline: Meaty idea
