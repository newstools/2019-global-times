Photo: IC People organizing, seducing or forcing minors and disabled people into using stimulants in sports could be sentenced to seven years in prison, according to a judicial interpretation released by China's Supreme People's Court on Monday.  The court also said that people who provide stimulants to students taking national college entrance examinations and civil servant exams will be punished under laws relating to cheating on exams, which could also lead to up to seven years in prison. The judicial interpretation came amid a growing trend  of youngsters using harmful stimulants in sports and their studies, according to an official from the Chinese Administration of Sports. Besides, the usage of stimulants has spread from sports into the food industry, seriously threatening the public's health, the official told the Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday. The interpretation, which will come into effect on January 1, 2020, also clarifies penalties on producing and selling stimulants as well as authorities' misconduct in related cases. It demonstrates China's determination to crackdown on illegal usage of stimulants, said an anonymous official.  Sun Yang, Chinese three-time Olympic swimming champion, sat a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) public hearing on Friday for alleged anti-doping rule violations.  Sun said he is innocent and the CAS Panel will deliberate and release its decision at a later date, according to Xinhua.
