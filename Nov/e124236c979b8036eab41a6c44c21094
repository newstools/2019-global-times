The exhibition aims to pass down his academic approaches as well as provide a platform for artists to exchange their experiences with one another. Artist Feng Yuan said at the opening that the paintings at the exhibition offer people the opportunity to learn more about the development of Chinese ink wash paintings. In the eyes of Tan Ping, vice president of the Chinese National Academy of Arts, this group of artists stood out while they were selecting works for the exhibition. All of them grew up after the founding of the People's Republic of China and mix tradition and innovation together in their paintings. In addition to the exhibition, an academic seminar for Chinese artists and art critics was held on Friday. Zhu Daoping, a painter from Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province, said that the exhibition and seminar are chances for artists to not only communicate, but also to look back and reflect.  The exhibition is set to end on November 26.
