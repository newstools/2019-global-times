A company spokesman said there were no other passengers on board."Upon arrival at the airstrip, the armed men stole the baggage and cargo that was on board the aircraft and fled the area," Matthew Brutnall said. "The captain was not injured during this event and the aircraft was not damaged" and has since been returned to Port Moresby.West New Britain Police Commander John Midi told AFP that "police still have no details on the cargo that was stolen and we will rely on the information given by the complainants."Midi confirmed the pilot was not injured, but may have been traumatized by threats from the armed assailants.This is not the first time Tropicair has suffered a hijacking. In 2007, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that ­security guards escorting a cash shipment forced Tropicair ­pilots to land at a disused World War II airfield and made off in a dinghy for the mainland.The pilots had quietly raised the alarm shortly after takeoff and police eventually managed to apprehend four of the armed men and recover the cash. A fifth man was shot dead.
