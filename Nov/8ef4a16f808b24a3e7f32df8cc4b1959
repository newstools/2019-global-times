Visitors study historic photos as they wait to see an escape tunnel underneath the Berlin Wall which was made visible to the public for the first time in Germany on Thursday. The wall divided the city for 28 years during the Cold War. The tunnel was built by a group of people who escaped communist East Germany to West Berlin. They wanted to help friends and family to flee to the West, but days before it was finished, East German officials discovered and destroyed it.
