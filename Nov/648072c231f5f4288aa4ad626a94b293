The results can work as a theoretical benchmarking baseline for achieve quantum supremacy.Wu said quantum computers' calculation ability has outperformed all supercomputers, and achieving quantum supremacy is a milestone in quantum computing development. Assessing this supremacy needs an effective quantum computing simulator, which will also serve as a significant tool to accelerate scientific research on quantum computing, Wu said. The method was demonstrated on China's Tianhe-2 supercomputer, Wu said. Google last week claimed that it had achieved a "quantum supremacy" milestone, which means that its computer performed a designated mathematical calculation in 200 seconds that a conventional computer would need 10,000 years to complete.Although China still lags the US in quantum computing hardware, the method developed by Wu's team has reached international leading levels, he said, adding that Google's research on quantum supremacy also quoted Chinese achievement.China is also developing its own quantum computers. Scientists from Hefei-based University of Science and Technology of China have independently developed the country's first control system for future quantum computers in 2018. The country is also investing in a national laboratory for quantum information science in Hefei, East China's Anhui Province, due to open next year, which "costs $10 billion," according to media reports. The US has long dominated the field with support from tech giants like Google. But China "has closed the technological gap" with the US in quantum information science, according to a commission affiliated to the US Congress.
