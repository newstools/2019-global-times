Malaysia is working to locate at least $4.3 billion in assets that have yet to be accounted for in a global money laundering probe into state sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), its anti-corruption chief said on Tuesday.

Former Malaysia prime minister Najib Razak is surrounded by supporters as he prays after a court appearance in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday.Razak was hit with 25 new charges of money laundering and abuse of power linked to the 1MDB mega-scandal (see story on page 8).

He had previously forfeited a $126 million yacht and $140 million in other assets.But about 18 billion ringgit ($4.34 billion) in assets remain unidentified and Malaysia was working with at least five countries to recover the amount, Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), told reporters."This [is] what we're working on... to locate, investigate and research where these properties are," Latheefa said.She declined to give further details on the assets sought or the countries involved, citing pending investigations.At least six countries, including Singapore and Switzerland, are investigating alleged graft and money laundering at 1MDB, founded by former prime minister Najib Razak.Najib, who lost a general election last year, has since been charged with 42 criminal offences related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities.He has consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers say he was misled by high-ranked officials at the fund.Malaysia estimates that Low stole more than $10 billion from 1MDB, attorney-general Tommy Thomas told the Nikkei Asian Review last month.Low, who faces charges in Malaysia and the United States over the scandal, has consistently denied wrongdoing. His whereabouts are unknown. He is living in a country that has refused to cooperate on efforts to retrieve him, Malaysian Inspector General of Police Abdul Hamid Bador said on Monday.
