A radio host who helped spread the word in the fight against Ebola has been stabbed to death at his home in northeast Democratic Republic of Congo, the army said Sunday.

A worker from the World Health Organization (WHO) decontaminates the doorway of a house where two cases of Ebola were found, in the village of Mabalako, Congo on Monday. Health officials have begun offering vaccinations to all residents in Mabalako. Previous efforts had only targeted known contacts or those considered to be at high risk.
