Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings' Chairman and CEO Pony Ma Huateng paid his travel fare by scanning a QR (quick response) code via WeChat's payment function on a bus in Hefei, capital of East China's Anhui Province late Wednesday. The whole process takes only 0.3 seconds. Point-of-sale machines for passengers to pay their bus fees via WeChat are currently only available on two bus routes in the city. The user number of WeChat in China and abroad is more than 963 million.

"That's primarily because of increasing competition that we are facing with the short video platforms."Tencent Music competes with Alibaba-backed NetEase Cloud Music in streaming services, and with short video sites such as Bytedance's Douyin and Tencent-backed Kuaishou in social entertainment.Although its music streaming unit has more users, the company's biggest revenue drivers are social entertainment services, including karaoke platforms, where users can live stream concerts and shows.The social entertainment business reported 12.2 million paying users during the quarter, up 23.2 percent.Yip said the firm will step up investment aimed at user growth, with a view to reach a younger demographic with content more appealing to them as well as initiatives such as offline singing competitions and partnerships with game studios.The company also said it is exploring opportunities to take its services outside China and hopes to introduce monetization methods such as virtual gifts to Thailand.Although Tencent Music's user base is nearly three times that of world's largest music streaming service, peer and stakeholder Spotify, its paying users are comparatively fewer.
