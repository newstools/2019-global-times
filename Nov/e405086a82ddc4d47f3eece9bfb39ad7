Lin grew up with a strong classical background and has won a number of titles at various competitions. "The new album was produced at a top studio with top equipment. All the songs are classics. I hope every fan will enjoy it," Lin said. Lin has also launched a national tour, which includes cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai.
