"The growth trend is optimistic and inviting, especially for foreign companies."China's retail sales increased 8.1 percent year-on-year in the January-October period to 33.48 trillion yuan ($4.8 trillion)., data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.Excluding sales of automobiles, the growth rate reached 9 percent.However, for some other foreign players, it might be a different story as they are abandoning the Chinese market due to intensifying competition and challenges.In October, German wholesaler Metro decided to sell a majority stake in its Chinese operations to Beijing-based Wumei Technology Group. Metro said it would sell about 80 percent of its stake in the Chinese operations and retain a 20 percent stake, according to media reports.Earlier this year, French supermarket Carrefour agreed to sell an 80 percent stake in its China unit to Suning International Group Co, a unit of Chinese retailer giant suning.com, for 4.8 billion yuan.The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the year as Carrefour China, which operates 210 hypermarkets and 24 convenience stores, has seen a sharp decline in sales."Those international brands entered the Chinese market years ago but they have experienced struggles after failing to update their strategies in a fast-changing and increasingly competitive market," said Zhang.They need to do more homework to understand Chinese consumers by innovation, when it comes to high-technology applications or new business models, he noted."We will continue to create an international business climate with a market orientation and rule of law, helping various retailers grow in the Chinese retail sector," said Gao.
