Chen said that unclear regulation is one of the main obstacles preventing institutional investors from adding digital assets to their portfolios. Institution-level technology and an attitude of embracing regulatory compliance are important to let institutional investors into the market, Chen noted.Ning Wang, an advisor for Trias, a public blockchain, introduced Trias technology and architecture and its applications for financial institutions, government departments and industrial scenarios. He also gave an introduction of Trias Fabric, which ensures data independence and privacy while providing security operations and status verification.Bo Zhang, executive director of SEFIN, a non-profit association for professionals in the finance industry, told the Global Times that blockchain technologies are seen as important both in China and the UK, with growing interest among governments and enterprises, adding that there are growing opportunities for closer collaboration between two vibrant blockchain ecosystems. The recent endorsement by Chinese President Xi Jinping has boosted an already fast-moving blockchain industry in China, while the UK has a well-rounded FinTech ecosystem with competitive advantages in terms of government and regulatory policy, according to a census of UK FinTech firms conducted by EY, said Zhang.Global Times
