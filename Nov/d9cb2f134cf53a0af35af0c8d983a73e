The participation benefits both sides as it increases the global cake," said Bai.China urges relevant countries to relax export controls on China, while the country will ramp up efforts to build an export control system to manage trade risks, according to the document."China needs such a system to protect domestic market entities," Bai said, adding that a certain country is cracking down on technology exports to China in the name of national security, which is totally against the principle of free trade."'National security' has become a US patent, a tool of executing double standards," Bai noted.According to Bai, China should have an "unreliable entity list" well in hand no matter what direction the China-US trade talks take. "Even though no specific company's name is placed on the list, the mechanism is necessary," he stressed.At Thursday's press conference, Gao disclosed no further information about the list.
