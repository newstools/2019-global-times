From the beginning of the incident, the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has directed its Consular Department and the embassy in Britain to coordinate directly with Vietnamese and British authorities, providing relevant information from Vietnam to assist the victims verification, setting a hotline to collect information and being ready to take protective measures in case there are Vietnamese victims, said Hang, adding that the Vietnamese embassy has also sent the identification of victims from British police to Vietnamese authorities for cross-checking.

"Vietnam strongly condemns human trafficking, considers it a serious crime and must be punished properly," Hang said, calling on other countries in the region and the world to step up cooperation in the prevention and combat of human trafficking crimes, so as not to repeat the same tragedies. "We hope that the British side will complete the investigation of the case soon, severely punishing those responsible for this tragedy," Hang said.
