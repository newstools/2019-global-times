Photo: Sun Wei/GTThe China Pavilion was unveiled on Monday at the World Travel Market (WTM) London, the leading global event for the travel industry.Themed "Amazing China, a country beyond your imagination," the China Pavilion looks like two carriages on the iconic high-speed bullet train, which visitors don't want to miss a chance to try when visiting China.The exhibition area has 40 sets of seats just like a train, with landscape posters from around 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities displayed on the carriage windows, creating a unique location for industrial traders to communicate.Liu Xiaoming, Chinese ambassador to the UK, said at the opening ceremony, "Both China and the UK are great civilizations. With profound histories, splendid cultures, magnificent landscapes and diverse customs, both countries have rich tourism resources."According to Liu, there are now 168 flights between China and the UK per week, facilitating more than 4,000 mutual visits every day. "As our economies continue to grow and people's lives continue to improve, today's tourists aspire for new, unique, informative and entertaining experiences. This requires the governments and tourism industries of our two countries to enhance mutual learning both in policies and in practice," Liu added.Chen Dongsheng, chief representative of Tianjin Airlines' London Office, told the Global Times that, according to data of the UK Civil Aviation Authority, the traffic flow between China and the UK has continued to grow in recent years, with the traffic volume in the first 10 months of this year increased by more than 20 percent year-on-year. "This is mainly due to the substantial boost in flight capacity between China and the UK," Chen said, adding that apart from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, many Chinese airlines have opened new routes to Qingdao, Chongqing, Xi'an and Chengdu to facilitate direct access to regional tourist destinations.Xue Ling, director of the China National Tourist Office London, said that China embraces epic mountains, magical lakes, boundless deserts and vast grasslands. With a total of 55 world heritage sites and 258 AAAAA-rated tourism areas as of October 2018, visitors will surely find their next dream vacation in China.Lord Michael Bates, a member of the House of Lords in the UK, and his wife Li Xuelin, shared their hiking experience in China with the documentary The New Stories of Zhejiang, which recorded their month-long 501-kilometer journey walking from Hangzhou to Wenzhou and the profound culture they experienced along the way in China. Lord Bates said he believes hiking is the best way to experience culture by leaving the metropolis behind, going to the countryside and talking to locals. Liu Lifeng, manager of China Sea International Travel Service Co Ltd, told the Global Times that demand for traveling to China is getting more diversified. Liu has attended WTM London for more than 20 years. Compared to the past, when most requests were to visit the country's most famous places of interest, Liu said that visitors nowadays want more tailored vacations since they want to better understand China. "With more visitors coming to China, travel agencies also want to stand out by offering something different," Liu added.Liz Linsell, director of Forever Young Travel Adventures in China, a travel agency based in South Africa, told the Global Times that she always recommends her clients visit China by train because they can then see the beautiful countryside. "The trains are amazing, clean and efficient, and you can meet and talk to people on the trains," she said. Linsell said she even helped organize overnight trains for people who want to save a bit of money on hotels. The three-day event will witness more then 10 eye-catching activities at the China Pavilion, including promotion of cultural tourism destinations and routes, the story of Xi'an by the famous British rock band The Hoosiers, a martial arts performance by monks from the Shaolin Temple in Henan Province and a traditional Chinese tea ceremony.WTM London is expected to attract 51,000 global travel trade professionals to the venue, where they will find new contacts, discuss business for the next year and share knowledge on how to move the industry forward.Newspaper headline: Beyond imagination
