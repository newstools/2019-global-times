Labour is proposing to create an emancipation educational trust "to ensure historical injustice, colonialism and role of the British empire is taught in the National Curriculum."It is also planning to launch reviews into the under-representation of minority ethnic teachers and into far-right extremism, if it wins the December 12 snap general election."Only by acknowledging the historical injustices faced by our communities can we work towards a better future," said Labour's equalities spokesperson Dawn Butler.Labour is proposing to establish a race equality unit in the Treasury finance ministry to review spending commitments for their impact on ethnic minority communities.Labour, which is seeking to return to power after almost a decade in opposition, also said it would tackle pay discrimination on the basis of race.The party unveiled its main political manifesto on Thursday.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said, "Labour is the party of equality and human rights. Our Race and Faith Manifesto presents our unshakable commitment to challenge the inequalities and discrimination that has faced too many communities ... Labour will tackle head on the barriers that have unfairly held back so many people and communities."Labour is currently being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission public body following a number of complaints about alleged anti-Semitism in the party.The investigation is to determine whether Labour has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimized people because they are Jewish. It will also examine whether it has responded to those complaints in a lawful and effective manner.The Britain Elects poll aggregator puts the governing Conservative Party on 42 percent, Labour on 30 percent, with the Brexit Party on 5 percent ahead of next month's general election.
