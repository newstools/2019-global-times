By contrast, a food retailer said that while tariffs had increased costs, the company "cannot raise prices on a whim" because of fierce competition.Business contacts in the Chicago Fed district reported that retail prices "increased modestly" and they expected prices to "rise at a somewhat faster pace" over the next 12 months."One contact said that food, home goods, and apparel retailers were struggling to pass on higher costs; in contrast, another contact noted that retailers continued to raise prices to reflect higher potential and realized tariffs," the survey showed.In the Richmond Fed district, several retailers also reported that tariffs were raising costs and hurting profit margins, according to the survey.U.S. consumers and businesses paid an additional 38 billion US dollars in tariffs from February 2018 to September 2019 due to US-China trade disputes, according to Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a US anti-tariff advocacy group."Economists, analysts and experts across the board agree the tariffs are hurting the economy," Jonathan Gold, a spokesperson for Americans for Free Trade, which is a coalition of US businesses, trade organizations and workers against tariffs, said in a statement earlier this month."The manufacturing industry slowed for the third month in a row in October; farm bankruptcies are on the rise; and business investment contracted for the second quarter in a row," Gold said, urging the US government to reach a final deal with China that "removes all tariffs."
