The robber's toy gun looks very real. Photo: Screenshot from Sina WeiboA man from East China has been accused of robbing two women of their belongings and their car at gunpoint, a highly unusual case as gun ownership is forbidden in China and robberies involving firearms are unheard of. Turns out, however, the country's strict gun laws are working as the weapon was merely a realistic-looking toy gun.Wearing a mask and brandishing the toy gun, the robber approached a white Porsche Cayenne parked by the roadside and demanded the two women in the car hand over their money and their mobile phones, local police of Leping in East China's Jiangxi Province told the media. He then demanded to be driven to a remote rural area and kicked the two women out of the car and drove away, said the local police. The two women later managed to report the robbery to local police who quickly found the lost Porsche. Police found and arrested the robber, surnamed He, 33, three days later in Rui'an, East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday. Police said He confessed and they recovered the toy gun, which might mitigate his punishment. The white Porsche Cayenne has been returned to its owner,  police said to the media. Netizens called for He to be severely punished even though he used a toy gun, saying his actions likely terrified the women. "People should take matters that threaten death very seriously," wrote a netizen on Twitter-like Sina Weibo.Global Times
