Their opinions will definitely boost the reform, Li said.Under the reform, military policies and institutions should be adjusted in accordance with the changing times as socialism with Chinese characteristics and national defense have entered a new era, said defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian at a November 2018 press conference, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The system, which is scheduled to be completely formed before 2022, will feature distinct guidance, full coverage, a rigorous structure and sound coordination, the spokesperson said.
