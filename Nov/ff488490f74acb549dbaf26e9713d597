For example, Baodu, first recorded in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), consists of fresh beef or lamb tripe cut into slices and then briefly blanched in boiling water before it's served. Douzhi, a fermented odorous drink made with mung beans and similar to soymilk, is also mentioned. Foreigners are often challenged to drink Douzhi when visiting Beijing but many disagree with the taste. Although the guide includes rich Beijing cuisine, Chinese netizens are not buying it. "Not all Michelin restaurants taste great as every person has different tastes, but most restaurants recommended by the guide are very expensive," said one Sina Weibo user."I don't think a Western-style guide can rank Chinese restaurants," said another Weibo user.Some netizens shared their personal experiences as evidence, claiming they had eaten at some of the restaurants mentioned in the guide, and the food was not as good.
