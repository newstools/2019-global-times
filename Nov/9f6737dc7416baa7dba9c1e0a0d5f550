Classic Chinese dance performance Butterfly Lovers kicked off its latest China tour at the National Centre for the Performing Arts on Tuesday night. 

 Adapted from the legendry tragic romance of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, the dance production staged by the Beijing Dance Academy just wrapped up its tour to the US, including Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle.  
According to the show's Director Li Hengda, who once choreographed the duo dance Liang Zhu in 1987, said that he got the idea for the show because he felt it was a pity that no Chinese troupes had put on sucha a dance show  as the ballet versions of Romeo and Juliet or Swan Lake.
 "I hope this latest Butterfly Lovers show can interpret that touching story as well as help Chinese dance find a place on the international stage ," he said.  
 The show will also be staged at the Beijing Dance Academy in January 2020.
