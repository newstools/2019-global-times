A mass coral spawning has begun on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, with early indications the annual event could be among the biggest in recent years, local marine biologists said Sunday.

An photo made available by the Arc Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies on Monday shows the bleaching damage on the corals of the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia.
