A bad record on the social credit system can affect a person's qualification to apply for loans or buy tickets for high-speed trains or flights. Wang's debts came after Beijing Pusi Investment Ltd (Prometheus Capital), in which he serves as the chairman and holds 100 percent of the shares, was ordered frozen from October 15 to October 14, 2022 by a Shanghai court. The amount that has been ordered frozen is not disclosed, according to tianyancha.com, an online platform that offers industrial and commercial enterprise data and registry information.The online video venture Panda TV, which Wang invested in, went bankrupt in March.The news that Wang was listed as judgment debtor has sparked a big splash on Chinese social media with his name topped the trending list on Sina Weibo.

He did not post anything in the past six months and the account appeared to be empty.Chinese entrepreneur Sun Yuchen tweeted on Weibo that he was considering helping Wang pay the debt, saying Wang "can give the money back to me," which netizens said was merely a publicity stunt.The social media topic "Sun Yuchen is considering helping Wang Sicong pay debts" has been viewed 84.67 million times.Sun won a charity auction for a lunch meeting with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett but canceled the July meeting claiming he had "a sudden kidney stone attack."
