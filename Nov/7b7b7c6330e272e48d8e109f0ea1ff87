"The glory actually goes to the states who were able to work together to find a solution."Aliu said he expects the agreement to be formalized in January or February 2020 and to take effect in April.The compromise comes despite decades of strained relations between Seoul and Tokyo over their wartime past, exacerbated in recent months by a simmering trade dispute. South Korean airlines have cut flights to Japan due to a plunge in passenger demand.Aliu declined to comment on relations between the two countries.Airline trade group International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in a statement that it knows the deal "will have a positive impact on safety and efficiency."The dangers were laid bare by two recent near misses between planes, which were blamed on conflicting air traffic control rights. Earlier this year, two commercial aircraft flew too close to one another, and in 2018 a FedEx plane nearly collided with two Korean low-cost carrier jets."The risk posed by the current configuration is known, and generally well mitigated," said one source familiar with the ICAO-led talks and the region. "However, mistakes can happen, and two errors - one in 2018 and another in 2019 - highlighted this concern."Additional routeThe present arrangements were drawn up in 1983, when South Korea had no diplomatic relations with China and there were only about 10 flights a day in the corridor.Since then, the corridor has become one of the busiest portions of airspace in the Asia-Pacific region, with 800 flights daily. The Montreal-based ICAO recognized the urgent need to streamline traffic control, with the corridor expected to become even busier next year as Japan prepares to receive more traffic ahead of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo."I personally got concerned about the situation," said Aliu, who was directly involved in the talks. "Because as you know, we will have the Tokyo Olympics coming and that will also mean many more flights."Under the new deal, Japan will benefit from an additional air route, Aliu said. A deal could lead to further additional routes, with an airway between China and Korea to be discussed after the Olympics.Andrew Herdman, director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said the prospective changes would aid capacity and operational efficiency.The Civil Aviation Administration of China could not be reached for comment. An official at South Korea's Transport Ministry said earlier on Wednesday that it had raised the air traffic control issue with the ICAO and remained in negotiations with Japan.An official at Japan's Transport Ministry said his country was discussing the AKARA corridor with other countries in accordance with ICAO principles.
