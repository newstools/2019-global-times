They can look like famous surgeons or accompany elderly patients when their children are away. The robot can mimic human facial expressions and talk to people, Liu said.Integrated with technologies like facial recognition, infrared sensing and 5G network, the robot would help doctors collect patient information, do physical examinations and accompany them, which helps improve the efficiency of treatment and patient satisfaction, and reduce errors, Liu noted.

"Such a robot could help doctors avoid unnecessary mistakes, especially during night shift," she said.
