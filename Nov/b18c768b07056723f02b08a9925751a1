Competitive sport was always a source of fun and community for Hannah Newman - until the British student came out as non-binary and considered giving up competing.

"It emphasizes being other or outsider in ways that are just not acceptable really."Rules debateMany major sports organizations have policies aimed at ensuring female players are not up against trans women early in transition who have high testosterone levels.A number of leading sports organizations, including the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), allow trans women to compete if their testosterone levels are reduced to well below average for men but above normal for women.But approaches are far from consistent. Some sporting groups require players to compete according to their birth certificate while others allow them to play by self-identity.Trans US powerlifter Mary Gregory was stripped of female world records at a strength contest in May after the RAW powerlifting federation running the event ruled that physically she was "actually male."There was also an outcry in 2017 when high school trans male wrestler Mack Beggs won a girls' state championship in Texas after being refused permission to compete against boys under rules requiring athletes compete under their sex at birth."Things need to change," said Beggs, 20, who made the documentary Mack Wrestles about his high-profile battle to be allowed to wrestle as a boy."It was absolutely crazy. I was only 17 years old. What 17-year-old needs to go through that all that unnecessary publicity, unnecessary exploitation, just because they're trans and they want to compete?"Some sports bodies are bringing in different formats that could help include more trans and gender minority players.The LGBT International Powerlifting Championships last year introduced a third gender category for trans, non-binary and intersex athletes.A number of sports bodies are also experimenting with mixed-gender events in moves that could benefit trans, non-binary and intersex players.Newman said her Limitless contest, which allowed contestants to select from three mixed-gender strength categories, showed non-gendered contests could work for some sports."We're at a crucial point now where this isn't going to go away," said Newman, who came last in the middle strength category in an interview at the gym after the competition."I'd like to think in the not-too-distant future there will be at least a lot more opportunities for people to be involved in sport."Newspaper headline: Gender Dilemma
