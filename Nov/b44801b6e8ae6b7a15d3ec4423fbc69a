(Xinhua/Evgeny Sinitsyn)Russian President Vladimir Putin said here on Wednesday that Russia will develop its military while simultaneously promoting disarmament. "Our army and navy have proved their high readiness, and we intend to build up our defense potential and put on combat alert systems of hypersonic, laser and other modern weapons that other countries do not yet have," Putin said at a meeting of high-ranking officers and prosecutors. "This is not a reason to threaten anyone. On the contrary, we are ready to do everything in our power to push the disarmament process with our latest weapon systems, the task of which is solely to guarantee security, taking into account the growing threats we are facing," he added, according to an official transcript. Putin noted that Russia does not want to be and will not be dragged into a cost-intensive arms race, which would be destructive to the country. However, developing advanced weapons is necessary amid tensions with the United States, said the president.
