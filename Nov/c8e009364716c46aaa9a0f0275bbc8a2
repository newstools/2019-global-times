In response to market rumors that Alibaba's online shopping platform Tmall had fabricated its sales volume figures from the Double 11 shopping festival, the firm said that it has launched judicial procedures with regard to the claim and that every order it generated was "absolutely authentic and accurate.""We hope there are no more such IQ tests that insult everyone's intelligence," a Tmall spokesperson said via the platform's Weibo account on Tuesday night, though the post had been deleted as of press time.Tmall's gross merchandise volume hit a record high of 268.4 billion yuan ($38.29 billion) on November 11, also known as Double 11 or the Singles' Day shopping festival in China. The sales figure came close to a prediction posted online in April by a netizen, who claimed that Alibaba employed complicated statistics models to fabricate a "beautiful" sales volume for Singles' Day and, based on the model, sales would appear to be about 268.9 billion yuan this year. "Alibaba's Jack Ma Yun is a big liar and he has been cheating global consumers for 10 years," the post claimed. In response, Tmall's chief public relations officer said in a WeChat post on Tuesday that with the netizen's logic, every number that is in line with a statistical predication is fabricated. "The global economy can also be predicted using statistical models, so are such numbers also being fabricated?"Late on Tuesday night, Tmall's spokesperson also assured the public about the authenticity of the sales data, while thanking every consumer for their purchases. It said that the firm is not surprised that market rumors aiming to hurt its reputation were circulated during the shopping festival. "Data may have been predicted but what we cannot predict is the booming potential of consumption, the technological power, the innovation of the manufacturing industry…as well as the surprise and expectations from millions of consumers," the post read.
