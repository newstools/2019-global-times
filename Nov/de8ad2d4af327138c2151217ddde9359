More than 170 shoe companies and retailers including adidas, Nike, Skechers and Under Armour have warned US President Donald Trump about the “catastrophic” effects of a trade war with China.

That creates trouble for moving forward in the negotiations," Sang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics, said. "If the US only wants to take and not give, it is risking the trade deal for some last-minute gains."Gao stressed that removal of tariffs should be "simultaneous and proportionate." Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that proportionate could mean that if the first phase trade deal covers 60 percent of the total deal, as US President Donald Trump has suggested, 60 percent of the existing tariffs should be removed. "That is understandably the ultimate goal for China," said Gao Lingyun. "There would be no point for China to take a deal that allows the US to keep all existing deals."Still, he remained upbeat about a potential deal in the near future, saying that an announcement could be made before December 15, even if the two sides were unable to sign one before then, to avoid technical problems with the new round of tariffs the US has threatened to impose on that date.
