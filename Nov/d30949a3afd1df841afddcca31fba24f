Abe reiterated to Moon that the issue of wartime forced labor was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations following Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule, NHK said.South Korea has been urging Japan to lift trade measures it imposed this year, as ties deteriorated.If Japan does so, South Korea says it could revoke a decision to end a pact on the sharing of military intelligence. The agreement expires later this month.South Korea's Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told a parliamentary session that the deal should be kept "if it helps with our security in any way," but the trade issues also needed to be resolved.
