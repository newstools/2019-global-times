A similar exercise was held in Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province in November 2018.China and the US are also participants of a land-based joint counter-terrorism drill held by ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) countries which kicked off on Wednesday in Guilin, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.Maintaining good military ties has a very positive impact on the overall relations between the two countries, Wei Dongxu said.Minister Wei and Esper made telephone contact on November 5 in which both sides stressed the importance of communication, cooperation and stability, according to statements from the Chinese Defense Ministry and US Defense Department.The Chinese minister also expressed China's principles and position on questions related to the island of Taiwan, the South China Sea, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, reads the Chinese Defense Ministry statement.The US has frequently sent naval vessels and aircraft through the Taiwan Straits and into the South China Sea over the past year in the name of freedom of navigation.China has been exercising restraint so no military confrontation have taken place between China and the US, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times.While both sides wish for stable and cooperative military relations, these US moves are testing China's patience and risk breaking the stabilizer, the expert said, noting the US should stop before it is too late.Newspaper headline: China, US defense ministers to meet in Bangkok: reports Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Western media creates illusion for human trafficking victimsBig baby makes debutChinese film debuts at DTLAFF
