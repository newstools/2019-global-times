Many netizens have shown anger toward the so-called "innovation" as well as its high price.A Weibo user named "Fuer Jiawa" commented, "Is this product treating schools like zoos and monitoring students like animals?"Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the Shanghai-based 21st Century Education Research Institute, said that allowing having students wear the headbands would equate to using the students as learning machines. "It's anti-education in disguise of technological innovation," he said.Earlier, media reports revealed that the products have been tested in two schools in Beijing and East China's Zhejiang Province.Global Times
