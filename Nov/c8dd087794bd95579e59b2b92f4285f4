Relevant agencies should take the reform of the disease prevention and control system as an opportunity to continue to innovate mechanisms and methods, ensure sound public health services, and focus on key areas, groups and links, he noted. While stressing the need to increase input in prevention and treatment, Li said scientific and technological research and development of drugs should be strengthened and the patients' life quality should be constantly improved. He said it is necessary to improve the effectiveness of education and intervention, strengthen monitoring and early warning, and give better play to the role of social organizations in AIDS prevention.
