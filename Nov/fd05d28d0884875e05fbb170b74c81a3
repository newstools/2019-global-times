Poster for The Journey of Ultimate Challenge Photo: ICExtreme sports documentary The Journey of Ultimate Challenge, produced by Toutiao, Watermelon Video and OXStudio, made its China debut on Wednesday. The first episode tracked two of the world's top freestyle kayakers, Dane Jackson and Nick Troutman, as they took on the Detian Waterfall in Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.   The largest waterfall in Asia, the Detian Waterfall is more than 200 meters wide and drops more than 70 meters. The average annual flow over the waterfall is 50 cubic meters per second, and the geology of the area is thick-layered dolomite. Water rushes down a three-tiered cliff with tremendous force, making navigation even more difficult.  During the first attempt by Dane, he fails and hurts his right arm. During a second attempt, the two are joined by three Chinese members. After several attempts over a few days, the team finally overcomes the challenging waters in the end.  The series is now available for streaming on the Toutiao and Watermelon Video sites.
