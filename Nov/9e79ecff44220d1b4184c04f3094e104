They can't afford to leave the largest and most promising market in the world."China has a middle class of about 400 million people, which is larger than the total population of the US.Catering to market demand in China, Tesla's new Shanghai Gigafactory is ready for production.Compared with the first-generation production line in California, the production layout and process at the factory in Shanghai is completely streamlined, the company said.
