Ayman Safadi made the announcement at a press conference, where he said the ambassador will return to Israel on Tuesday or Wednesday. Jordan is committed to the peace treaty with Israel and peace is a strategic Arab option, he noted. The announcement came just a day after Jordan announced the official termination of an agreement which leases part of the kingdom's land to Israel. This decision serves Jordan's interests, Safadi said.
