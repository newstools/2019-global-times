A series of housing projects in 22 impoverished counties in southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have benefited around 396,100 households since 2018, not only providing better homes for those who once lived in shabby residences but also boosting their source of livelihood. Measures including "toilet revolution" and flower planting have been carried out in these poverty-stricken villages. Based on the successful experience in the south of Xinjiang, local authorities have pushed forward the building of "beautiful courtyard" project in all villages of Xinjiang in a bid to improve locals' living standards since 2019.

In her opinion, Xinjiang is a place where many ethnic groups live together harmoniously.She said the passage of the Xinjiang-related bill mirrored Washington's hegemonic mindset to use "human rights" as a cover to mislead public opinion.Ezzat Saad, director of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, paid a visit two years ago to Urumqi, capital city of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. He said that Xinjiang's economic development and social progress are closely related to its anti-terrorism and anti-extremism measures.No country has the right to interfere in Xinjiang affairs, which are China's internal affairs, he said, adding that the United States using the so-called "human rights issues" to meddle in China's internal affairs is "blackmail."Bambang Suryono, an Indonesian scholar and president of the Jakarta-based think tank Nanyang ASEAN Foundation, said the Xinjiang-related bill passed by the US House of Representatives, which ignores the facts and confuses right with wrong, is an example of hegemonism and interventionism.The effective policies implemented by the Chinese government focus on the long-term stability and sound development of Xinjiang, providing inspiration to other countries, Suryono said.
