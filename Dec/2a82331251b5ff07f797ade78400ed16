The Central American country's president also went to Tian'anmen Square on Tuesday afternoon and laid a wreath at the Monument to the People's Heroes.

But Washington should realize that its image among Latin America is declining, since many countries in this region don't want to be the US' backyard, if they had a choice."Even some small countries, like El Salvador and Panama, have already refused to follow Washington's instructions on foreign affairs, and established diplomatic ties with China. They know that following the US has nothing to offer anymore, but China can offer a lot, including a market, investment and infrastructure construction," he said. Zhao said El Salvador is just doing the same thing the US did 40 years ago (establishing formal diplomatic ties with the PRC). But the US is making trouble and pressuring it, and this is very unreasonable and makes no sense.
