Data from other countries also closely matches the equation, he noted."Every countries' data can fit into an equation, because the equation is generated from the data," Wang said. If the China's organ donation data was generated by the equation, then any four-year number would fit the equation, Wang said. But through cooperation with mathematicians of Peking University, Wang and his team found that any four-year number from China's organ data generates different equations.

The number of organ donations in 2018 ranked second in the world.Since the establishment of a green channel for organ transport three years ago, the transfer time for organs has been shortened by an average of 1 to 1.5 hours and the overall organ sharing rate   has increased by 7.3 percent, the Chinese mainland data showed.
