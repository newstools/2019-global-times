US President Donald Trump called Justin Trudeau "two-faced" after the Canadian Prime Minister appeared to be caught on camera joking about his press appearances during a chat with other leaders at a NATO summit in Britain.Trudeau was filmed at a Buckingham Palace reception on Tuesday describing how surprised US officials appeared to be by Trump's performance at an earlier press."...It was like a 40-minute press conference," Trudeau said, "Forty minutes."Trudeau added with a chuckle: "I just watched his team's jaws drop to the floor.""That was funny when I said the guy's two-faced," Trump was caught saying on an audio clip following a lunch with some NATO leaders.At a final news conference, Trudeau played down the incident, saying he and Trump had enjoyed a great meeting and that the jaw-dropping comment was a reference to the announcement of the location of the next meeting of G7 leaders at the US presidential retreat, Camp David.
