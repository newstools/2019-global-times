As the process of denuclearization and permanent peace for the Korean Peninsula is at a vital point, close communication between China and South Korea will benefit the safety and stability of the Northeast Asia region, Moon said, the Yonhap News Agency reported. China is willing to keep close communication on high-level exchanges, to connect the Belt and Road Initiative with South Korea's development plans and to accelerate the second phase of negotiation on China-South Korean free trade agreement, Wang said, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Wang also called for signing  of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in 2020 and acceleration of the establishment of the China-Japan-South Korean free trade zone.
