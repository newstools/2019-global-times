"This is quite a severe disease and we just aren't used to seeing it, so it comes as quite a surprise when we see how fatal it can be."Hagen said increased access to measles vaccines was estimated to have saved 21 million lives over the past 20 years."But we are starting to have a slide back and there are outbreaks happening all over the world in all WHO regions and it's leading to the virus being exported through international travel," he said.Cases have skyrocketed in Europe, leading to Britain, Greece, the Czech Republic and Albania all losing their measles-free status in August.The US narrowly maintained its "measles eliminated" status a few months later, despite experiencing its worst outbreak since 1992.
