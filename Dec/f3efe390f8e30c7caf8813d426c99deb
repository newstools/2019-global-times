"We are also willing to shoulder our due international obligations and responsibilities."Xi briefed the delegates on China's state governance as well as his opinions on the current international situation.He said upholding the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental reason why the People's Republic of China had achieved continuous development and stability over the past 70 years."We will unswervingly continue down the path that we have chosen," he said, reiterating the country's commitment to reform and opening up and expressing his full confidence in China's future.China has always maintained that people of various countries have the right to choose a development path that suits their own national conditions. No country or nation could achieve its development and prosperity through copying others', nor is there a particular path that could guide all countries and nations towards prosperity, he noted.China is determined to prove with its own practice that a strong nation is not necessarily a hegemony, and this is decided, first and foremost, by China's 5,000-year historical and cultural tradition, which advocates the ideal of "pursuing a just cause for the common good," instead of I-win-you-lose zero-sum games, Xi said.He said China is committed to maintaining equality and mutual benefit in international relations, increasing mutual understanding and carrying out mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries for the joint building of a community with a shared future for humanity.
