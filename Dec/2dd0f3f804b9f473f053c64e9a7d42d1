A handout picture taken on Saturday and released on Sunday by the SIRPA, the French army press service, shows French soldiers of the Barkhan force carrying the coffin of a soldier who died when two French military helicopters collided in Mali on November 25, in the French Army base in Gao. The crash occurred late on November 25, during an operation in the Liptako region, near the borders with Burkina Faso and Niger. It was the heaviest single loss for the French military in nearly four decades.
