Photo: VCGNew York City's iconic Rockefeller Center Christmas tree was illuminated Wednesday night during its famous annual ceremony, marking the beginning of another holiday season in the Big Apple.Thousands of people from around the world gathered in Midtown Manhattan for the 87th lighting celebration, as an array of singers and dancers performed around the tree's wide base.The Norway Spruce, 23 meters tall, was transported 97 kilometers from Orange county in upstate New York and erected in New York City on November 9.The 60-year-old tree weighs 14 tons and is decorated with numerous rainbow lights that if laid flat would stretch some eight kilometers. A 400-kilogram star made from Swarovski crystals was placed atop the tree on November 13.This year, for the first time, streets around the tree have been designated as pedestrian-only zones, to avoid overcrowding.The tree will be illuminated every day from 5:30 pm to 11:30 pm through January 7, 2020, except on Christmas day, when the tree's lights will shine for 24 hours.The tree-lighting ceremony at the Rockefeller Center dates back to 1933.Â Since then, the venue has been the focal point of New York City's holiday celebrations.
