"I looked out of the window, and saw three people on the ground. I looked out in time to see the shooter ... shoot himself."Due to the fatal incident, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (JBPHH), which combines two bases of Pearl Harbor Naval Station and Hickam Air Force Base, was temporarily closed for about two hours.
