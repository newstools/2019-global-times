No other details have been given.Local media quoted Police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson as saying officers on the 700 block of Canal Street at the time believed that they were being fired upon."We had officers on that very block that thought they were being fired upon," Ferguson told reporters."Unfortunately, there were so many people out here we were unable to ­determine who was actually firing shots at the time. We do not know how it ­started."The French Quarter has been hosting holidaymakers marking the weekend ­after Thanksgiving.Thousands of fans and alumni have also been drawn to the city for the Bayou Classic football game traditionally played on Thanksgiving weekend between Southern University and Grambling State University.On the same weekend in 2016, a man was killed and nine other people injured in a shooting on Bourbon St.In June 2014, another shooting incident on Bourbon St left one person dead and nine injured.
