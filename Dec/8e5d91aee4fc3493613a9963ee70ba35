We must strengthen education of these."The Hong Kong government should strengthen education on the Constitution and the Basic Law to promote the national identity and awareness among different groups of Hong Kong society, especially among civil servants and the youth, she noted.Kennedy Wong Ying-ho, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the government is the key to realizing this goal. "The HKSAR government didn't establish an evaluation system to test the knowledge and understanding on the Constitution and Basic Law for civil servants, educators, social workers and medical workers. There are only some study sessions which are totally not enough," Wong said.Chinese observers noted that after 1997, Hong Kong civil servants have gained huge power in city governance, but most had not studied enough of the Constitution, Basic Law and the "one country, two systems" principle, and that's why some of them have some misunderstanding and made mistakes implementing the law.The government should set up an examination system on the Constitution, Basic Law and "one country, two systems" for civil servants, Wong said. "The officials can get promotion only after they pass the exam," he said. It was not easy but the government should have the determination and courage to do the right thing, Wong noted. "In the past, the government was too weak to insist correct policies and make compromise easily while facing with disagreements. Today's situation is the consequence."
