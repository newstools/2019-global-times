In 1968, Peter Glaser, an American aerospace engineer, wrote a formal proposal for a solar-based system in space.China has proposed various sunlight collecting solutions and made a number of major breakthroughs in wireless energy transmission since the country listed space-based solar power as a key research program in 2008.However, ambition has long been a challenge for current technology because it involves the launch and installation of numerous solar panel modules and the efficient wireless transmission of mega energy.With an investment of 200 million yuan (28.4 million U.S. dollars), China is building a testing base in Bishan, southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, for the research of high-power wireless energy transmission and its impact on the environment.Researches in this field will spur the country's space science and innovation in emerging industries like commercial space transportations, Wang said.
