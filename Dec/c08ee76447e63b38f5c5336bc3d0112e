Nine extendable batons and four pepper sprays were also seized.Eight males and three females, aged between 20 and 63, have been arrested in the operation for offenses including possession of firearm without licence, possession of dangerous goods, possession of prohibited weapons and unlawful assembly.Li said the police are investigating where the weapons come from and may make more arrests as the operation is still ongoing.
