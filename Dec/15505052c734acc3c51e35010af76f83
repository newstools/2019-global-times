Photos: AFPChinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin inaugurated the China-Russia east route natural gas pipeline by video link-up on Monday sending a signal that energy and cooperation in other sectors between the two countries are becoming the key to boosting multilateralism. Entering service the same day, the pipeline will help Russia export up to 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to China, according to an article posted on the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) website on Monday.That's almost one-third of China's total natural gas imports in 2018. About 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia will be delivered to China in 2020 and will be gradually increased to 38 billion cubic meters per year, the article said.CNPC is responsible for the construction and management of the project within China: Stretching from Russia's Siberia to China's Yangtze River Delta, the pipeline covers 8,000 kilometers, of which 5,111 kilometers fall within Chinese borders. The project extends from Heihe in Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province to North China's Hebei Province and finally to Shanghai in East China across a total of nine provinces and municipalities.Russia will deliver a total 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas to China over the 30 years of contract, media reports said.Following 20 years of negotiations, China and Russia reached the more than $400 billion contract in May 2014, the CNPC article read.A China-Russia west route and China-Far East pipelines are also under discussion, the article said.
