There were a lot of roofs flying during the typhoon too," said Junie Castillo, a disaster officer in one of the areas first hit.Due to the high winds, Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport was "closed for operations," General Manager Ed Monreal told AFP.It was not clear when flights would resume, but authorities gave an estimate of 11:00 pm (15:00 GMT) Tuesday and said their decision would depend on the weather.Nearly 500 flights were canceled, and officials warned passengers not to come to the airport.One of the terminals AFP visited, which would normally be bustling with morning departures, was occupied by a handful of staff and stranded passengers.About 340,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in the central ­Bicol region, disaster officials said.The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, killing hundreds and putting people in disaster-prone areas in a state of constant poverty.The country's deadliest cyclone on record was Super Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.
