He worked pretty hard at school, and at the spare time he also created lots of paintings to call on people to care for the HIV-infected group. Embraced by love and feeling accepted, the once skinny and timid little boy finally grew into an optimistic teenager and has been integrated into society with the label "AIDS orphan" gradually fading away.
