US President Donald Trump on Monday announced plans to re-impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina, hitting back at what he called their "unfair" policies.

Industry leaders in both countries cried foul."Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies," which is hurting American farmers, Trump said on Twitter."Effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel & Aluminum that is shipped into the US from those countries."Trump last year announced global tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum but later approved exemptions for some countries, including Argentina and Brazil - after they agreed to quotas.Bolsonaro sought to play down the issue, saying he would appeal to Trump for more understanding of Brazil's position and boasting he has an "open channel" with the US leader if needed.Later, in a radio interview, Bolsonaro said: "I hope he understands and doesn't penalize us in this matter."The Brazilian leader added he was confident he would receive a favorable hearing from the US president. "I am almost convinced that he will hear us," he said.For its part, Argentina's labor and production ministry said in a statement that it had asked the US for clarification about the announcement and was looking into possible "joint action" with Brazil in response.

Because it is very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers." "Our steel companies will be very happy and our farmers will be very happy with what I did," Trump added.Economic impact Brazil has teetered on the brink of recession this year, and Argentina is again enmeshed in an economic crisis, which has led to the currencies of both countries weakening against the US dollar.A weaker currency tends to make exports more competitive, while a stronger US dollar makes foreign goods cheaper for American consumers.But as the global economy slows, the US dollar tends to strengthen as it becomes a safe haven for nervous investors around the world.Jose Urtubey, spokesman for Argentina's powerful UIA industrial lobby, said producers in the country will be harmed immediately by the tariffs.With Argentina's "lack of competitiveness" as a producer, the fact that the United States had the lowest steel and aluminum tariffs was "beneficial," Urtubey said.The head of Argentina's only aluminum producer, Javier Mandanes Quintanilla of the Aluar Group, viewed the tariff plan with trepidation."This is a measure that affects us very strongly," he told La Nacion.The US imported nearly 169,000 tons of steel from Argentina last year, representing more than $220 million in trade.Bolsonaro's right-wing government has promised to revive Brazil's flagging economy with a massive stimulus plan, as well as pension and tax reforms, and the central bank has cut the key interest rate more than a dozen times since late 2016.Trump views those moves as an effort to gain at the expense of the United States.In his tweets, Trump also called on the Federal Reserve to "likewise act" so other nations no longer "take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies." Amid a slowing global economy and the impact of Trump's wide-ranging trade offensive, mostly directed against China, the Fed has cut the benchmark interest rates three times this year. But it has signaled it will stand back before deciding on any further moves.Despite widespread complaints about the impact of the tariffs on US businesses and consumers, as well as the hit to farmers who have been the target of retaliation from trading partners, Trump claimed in his tweet on Monday that Washington has taken in "massive amounts of money" from the tariffs.American steel has continued to suffer, with overall employment edging downward and production halted at blast furnaces last month. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 48.1 from 48.3 the month before.Newspaper headline: Steely standoff
