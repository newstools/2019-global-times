Rabehi stressed that "Algerian people have become aware of these heinous schemes and they are determined to participate in voting on December 12," the official APS news agency reported. He added that Algeria does not accept the interference of others in its internal affairs and this is an unchangeable principle in its policy.

The resolution urges the Algerian government to "find a solution to the current (political) crisis based on a peaceful and open political path."
