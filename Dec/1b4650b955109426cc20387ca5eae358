(Xinhua/Qin Qing)The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will expand fiscal expenditure within its means to ease economic burden on individuals and companies. But restoring social order is the essential premise to recover economic growth, experts said on Sunday.It may record its first budget deficit in 15 years in the 2019-20 fiscal year, which ends in March.Due to the ongoing violence and gloomy economic environment, the HKSAR government has had lower tax receipts and land sales income this year. Together with rounds of economic bailouts that cost HK$20 billion ($2.55 billion), the government is expected to run a deficit for the current fiscal year, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, said in a blog post on Sunday.The government should adopt an expansionary fiscal policy to support the economy through counter-cyclical measures, and to ease pressure on the economy and stabilize public confidence, Chan said."A history of prudent macroeconomic policies has left the Hong Kong SAR with significant buffers to address both cyclical and structural challenges," the IMF said in a report on Wednesday.
