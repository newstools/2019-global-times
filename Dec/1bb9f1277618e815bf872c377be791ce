The market is closely watching whether a phase one trade deal could be signed before December 15.At the Gala 2019 of the US-China Business Council, Cui said fostering détente is the social responsibility of both Chinese and American companies, which are all stakeholders for the development of China-US relations.

However, the risk of decoupling between the world's two largest countries kept increasing with a continuing trade war. Orlins said even if a deal is signed as a phase one agreement addressing the trade and tariff war, the near-term outlook of the China-US relationship is very pessimistic as incorrect assumptions are taking a firm hold.He urged citizens of the two countries to speak out and make their voices heard to the respective governments and media as it is the people that ultimately decide the relationship of the two countries. "If you struggle with me, we will win," Orlins said.Orlins cited a poll published in October by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs in which 42 percent of the surveyed believe the development of China is a critical threat to the US, but 68 percent prefer a policy of friendly cooperation and engagement rather than working to limit China's growth and prosperity.Global Times Futuristic cars on displayBig baby makes debutAntique cars highlighted in US auto shows Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
