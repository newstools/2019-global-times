A newly married couple in East China's Anhui Province, wore outfits suitable for dynastic royalty, but did without the newer tradition of a caravan of expensive limousines, and took a high-speed train to their wedding reception. The bride, surnamed Ma and the groom, surnamed Xu, wanted their wedding day mixed with traditional and contemporary elements. Xu picked up his bride at her home well before noon, as is tradition in many places of China, with tickets for the 08:55 am high-speed rail to his hometown. Coincidently, it was the train line's first official day of operation.   "We canceled our wedding car caravan because we wanted to make our day different by taking the train," Ma said.The couple also saved a lot of money and time. The chauffeured limos would have likely cost 10,000 yuan ($1,430) and the train ride cut 40 minutes off their journey. Beaming with joy, the couple is seen handing out wedding favors to surprised passengers, who took videos and photos of the hipster couple.
