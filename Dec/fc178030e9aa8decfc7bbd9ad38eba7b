Saudi Arabia is going to launch a similar project, but China is leading the way," he said."It seems to me that China is giving us important lessons on how to combat climate change, and from a perspective of caring for the soil, biodiversity and especially people," said Gutierrez, adding, "we are learning from China."The UN official said he has high hopes that the COP25, which opened on Monday and will close on Dec. 13, will mark "a step forward" in taking decisive actions against the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming."We are short on time," he said, calling on countries to "be able to come to reasonable, viable agreements so ... we can begin to take firm steps," he said."2020 is the year that will define our future. The planet has already grown one degree Celsius warmer. If it warms another degree Celsius, we will be past the point of no return," he warned."We can't continue treating the issues of biodiversity, of land deterioration, of climate change as separate agendas. We have to pool our efforts and support countries so they take action," he added.
