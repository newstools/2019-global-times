A husband sits on the floor of a hospital corridor to serve as his pregnant wife's chair, while they waiting for her checkup. Screenshot from Sina WeiboNetizens are praising a gallant husband who sat on the floor of a hospital hallway so his late-term pregnant wife could sit on his back while the couple waited to see a doctor for what is likely her final checkup before giving birth.The man is seen holding his wife's coat in his left hand, and occasionally passing her a bottle of water.  The video taken by a netizen, shows the very large and obviously uncomfortable woman thumping her thighs to relieve numbness in her legs after standing for a long time. The video also sparked controversy as it shows a number of men sitting on nearby seats and not offering the woman a more comfortable place to rest. There are also unoccupied seats 20 meters away, but it's likely that the couple didn't want to lose their place in line to see the doctor.  Netizens also wondered why a pregnant woman couldn't make an appointment in advance to see a doctor, instead of having to wait in a hallway that lacked seats.  "What a nice husband! But if those men knew what it was like to be pregnant, I doubt whether they would remain in their seats," said a netizen on Twitter-like Sina Weibo. "That's what real love looks like," said another. Global Times
