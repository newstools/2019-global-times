At the same time it cannot be cut overnight, as the court verdict on the issue came in favour of us," the minister noted.The volume of default loans jumped by nearly 24 per cent to Tk 1,162.88 billion, as on September 30, from Tk 939.11 billion, as on December 31, 2018, despite the BB's close monitoring.The minister also said the single-digit interest rate on lending will also help bring down the amount of NPLs.When contacted, a senior official told the FE that two chairmen - one from public banks and another from private banks, and four managing directors (MDs) and chief executive officers (CEOs) - one from public banks and three from private banks - have been included in the new committee.The committee will also consider ensuring profitability of the banks (after implementing single-digit lending rate), according to the BB official."We also want to bring down the interest rate on lending to single-digit from the existing level to facilitate the country's economic growth," Syed Mahbubur Rahman, Chairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB), told the FE after the meeting.
