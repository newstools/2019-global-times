He was previously sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2016 for fraud. Australian TV program 60 Minutes Australia on November 24 released a 60-minute video in which Wang claimed he had been involved in espionage activities for China and Federal MP Andrew Hastie, the head of the nation's parliamentary intelligence committee, another interviewee, said Wang deserves Australia's protection.
