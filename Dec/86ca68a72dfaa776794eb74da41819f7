Through the pipeline, Russia will deliver a total of 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas to China over the next 30 years.About 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia will be delivered to China in 2020, and the amount will be gradually increased to 38 billion cubic meters per year, the CNPC on Monday said in a statement on its website.The company's pipeline branch is responsible for the construction and management of the project.Stretching from Russia's Siberia to China's Yangtze River Delta, the pipeline covers a total length of 8,000 kilometers, and 5,111 kilometers within Chinese borders.

The east natural gas pipeline has become a landmark project of China's third-generation pipeline construction.China's petroleum and natural gas pipeline network is expected to cover 240,000 kilometers by 2025, according to China's guidance in the sector. About 100,000 kilometers of new petroleum and natural gas pipeline will be constructed.In the first 10 months of this year, China imported 415 million tons of crude oil, up 10.5 percent year-on-year, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.
