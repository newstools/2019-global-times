Discussion of relaxing the limit might start in 2019, if more cases emerge," said Li Daxiao, chief economist at Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities.More foreign cash is expected to flow in as index provider MSCI is increasing the weight of A shares in some of its indices, experts noted. But they cautioned that inflows of foreign capital are bringing opportunities and challenges to China's capital market. To attract more long-term investment in the A-share market, China raised the A-share foreign ownership limit for Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) from 20 percent to 30 percent in 2012. Foreign investment through the connect program linking Hong Kong and exchanges on the Chinese mainland is considered the major driver of A-shares' surge since the Chinese Lunar New Year.The Shanghai Composite Index has risen from 2,465 points at the beginning of this year to 3,102 points on Wednesday, while the Shenzhen Component Index rose from 7,149 points to 9,700 points.Northbound capital through stock link programs reached about 121 billion yuan ($18.06 billion) in the first two months of this year, according to the Shanghai Securities News on Tuesday.  The reform of the A-share market is being pushed by evolving external conditions, but the goal is to establish a healthy and resilient market step-by-step, Liu Xuezhi, a senior expert in macroeconomics at Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Wednesday.China shares the same goal of building a healthier, opener, freer and more resilient market with foreign investors, Liu noted.Newspaper headline: Foreign ownership limit likely to be relaxed on nation’s A shares China opens its first Mars simulation base in Qinghai ProvinceChina lowers defense budget growth to 7.5% in 2019Chinese actor Li Dongxue talks about his role in the newest TV adaptation of Louis Cha's wuxia novel 'The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber' Fire drillUS massage industry needs regulations for developmentFirecracker Run
