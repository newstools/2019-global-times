"Many positive results are yet to come but I am sure that this visit will be a great success," he said. Easing concerns Analysts noted that along with deeper cooperation, Europe is showing greater anxiety about China and Xi's visit will help ease such concerns."China's economic and technological development, such as in the telecom industry [for example, Huawei's 5G technology] has challenged Europe's old view of a bilateral trade structure. They feel a sense of alienation in their ascendancy," Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Monday.However, in fact, Europe still has great advantages. China has always been stressing on cooperation and will make efforts to enhance Europe's understanding of China, Sun said. Meanwhile, the rise of China is an irreversible trend that Europe should adapt to. Xi's visit is a great opportunity for Europe to know more about China. Only after Europe accepts the rise of China could the two sides cooperate further, Sun pointed out.On Monday, a joint seminar on global governance, held by China and France, held its opening ceremony, which will discuss the two countries' interconnection and developments, multilateralism, digital governance and climate change, as well as biodiversity protection. Chen Xin, research fellow at the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the Belt and Road Initiative and Europe's EuroAsia Interconnector are platforms to people of both sides. China can share its technology and experiences in the effective implementation of infrastructure construction, such as the high-speed railway system.China and France are permanent members of the UN Security Council, which means they both shoulder the responsibility of global governance. The platform is a key framework for them to promote multilateralism, said Chen.Analysts noted that China and France have the potential for future cooperation in nuclear energy and aerospace. China-France Oceanography Satellite, known as the CFOSat, took off on October 29, 2018 and gathered a large amount of marine environmental data.Chen Qingqing contributed to this story EU to shun American assault against HuaweiChina, Italy sign BRI MoU to advance connectivityChina's J-10 fighter jet celebrates its birthday amid Pakistani parade Allahu AkbarSurprising discovery
