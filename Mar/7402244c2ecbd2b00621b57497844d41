The festival falls on April 5 this year. Authorities in Jingjiang, East China's Jiangsu Province, started to pull down local tombs with excavators on Sunday. Each family will receive 200 yuan per tomb that was destroyed as compensation, the Legal Daily reported Tuesday.You Ling, a basic-level civil servant, slammed such crude actions, calling for more respect and better measures to promote the national funeral reform.
