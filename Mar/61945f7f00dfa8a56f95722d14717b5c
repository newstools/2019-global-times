Children at an elementary school in Huaying, Sichuan Province, are taught about food safety Monday, with the help of employees from local industrial and commercial administration bureaus. Food safety issues have become increasingly high profile across the country in recent years, and some of the leading companies in various fields from the dairy industry to the retail sector have been involved in food scandals, prompting the government to enhance public awareness of food safety and quality.

The school said it would punish the students who bought take-out food. "The school told us food outside is not safe," she said.The scandal has sparked outrage on Chinese social media, with netizens slamming the school's unscrupulousness and urging authorities to investigate and punish the responsible party as soon as possible.
