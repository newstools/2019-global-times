And their books would be very attractive for people to read. And John Chinnery's book opens the door and a window for English people to understand a little bit more about Chinese culture."At the book launch, CIPG also held a book donation ceremony where they presented multilingual books on China to the Chinese embassy in the UK and also new books published by New World Press and Global China Press to the University of Cambridge, University of Westminster, and Lord Wilson of Culworth and his wife.
