If approved, the JV will become the country's first foreign-controlled lender.Yi vowed that China will continue to pursue opening of the financial services sector, giving equal treatment to both Chinese and foreign institutions in areas including shareholding.Quicken the paceIt's a good time to quicken the pace of financial opening in China, Peter Tyroller, a member of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH, told the Global Times on the sidelines of the forum on Sunday.Still, "cautiously considering the risk of opening too fast means being careful while seeing the necessity to open," he said.A new industry catalog to encourage foreign investment will attract multinational companies to invest in China and set up manufacturing and research and development centers in the country, Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said Sunday at the forum.Foreign direct investment in China hit $135 billion last year, an indication that the country remains one of the most attractive investment destinations worldwide, according to Ning.In another sign, the World Bank Group's annual business environment report, released in late October 2018, showed China advancing to a global ranking of 46 from the previous year's 78, which the World Bank attributed to the country's brisk reform efforts. Speaking on Saturday at the Economic Summit, part of the CDF, Han Wenxiu, executive deputy director of the General Office of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, said "we advocate making a bigger cake and sharing the cake, and not engaging in a 'zero-sum game'."The crystal-clear opening-up signals apparently provide a boost for foreign investors seeking opportunities in the Chinese market. Open environment"The investment environment in China has been increasingly open, and the business environment in China is as well improving. These chances provide multinational companies with vast space for their development in China," Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish pharmaceutical and biologics group, told the Global Times. Johansson also reflected on the newly approved Foreign Investment Law, which was in the spotlight at the forum.China will ramp up efforts to flesh out the newly passed foreign investment law to protect the legitimate rights of foreign-invested businesses, senior government officials pledged at the CDF.In a conspicuous attempt to make the country more appealing to foreign investors, China's top legislature earlier in March approved the new foreign investment law, which will take effect on January 1, 2020. The new law demonstrates the Chinese government's attitude and its determination to further open up the nation's market, Johansson said, stressing the company believes that the investment environment in China will become more open, fair, transparent and predictable. "Therefore, we will further increase our investment in China," he said.Newspaper headline: China on course for greater opening-up China develops anti-stealth radarsJF-17 Block 3 jet expected to be fitted with active electronically scanned array radarMass shooting exposes Western flaws Allahu AkbarSurprising discovery
