Its shipments dropped 11.7 percent to 36.3 million units, while market share shrank to 9.1 percent from 9.3 percent, according to data tracker IDC.Huawei ranked first with a 26.4 percent market share, followed by OPPO with 19.8 percent, Vivo with 19.1 percent and Xiaomi with 13.1 percent.Apple is having a "mid-life crisis" as its market position in China has been squeezed by local competitors in recent years, Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Given that Apple is trying to win back the Chinese market by lowering iPhone prices, its new services will be more vital than ever before, as these products will be more profitable and are less likely to be affected by price competition from rivals, Liu said. "Apple's new services, designed for the global market, also aim to attract Chinese consumers. It is possible they will enter China by the end of the year after the products comply with local regulations and laws," said Wu Hao, a Shenzhen-based independent industry analyst.Chinese technology companies such as Tencent and ByteDance have grown rapidly thanks to their fast-developing technology and abundant products and services, and Apple can be inspired by the growth of these domestic companies, Liu said.Cook has come to China 14 times and visited several Chinese technology companies. In October 2018, Cook met with Zhang Yiming, CEO of Bytedance."The news business of ByteDance has developed soundly, and it's possible that Cook and Zhang could have shared their experience and learned from each other," Liu said."I'm looking forward to Apple's TV+ service, which will feature Apple productions with participation from Hollywood celebrities such as Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Aniston. That's really attractive to me," Lan Yong, a university student in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Newspaper headline: Apple eyes new services for growth EU to shun American assault against HuaweiChina, Italy sign BRI MoU to advance connectivityChina's J-10 fighter jet celebrates its birthday amid Pakistani parade Allahu AkbarSurprising discovery
