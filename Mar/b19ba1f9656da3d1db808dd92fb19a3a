A boy stands near a model of the moon hanging above the Olympic swimming pool at the National Aquatics Center, known as the Water Cube, in Beijing. The moon model is part of an exhibit on China's moon exploration technology and achievements. China landed its first rover on the moon in 2013 and plans to land a rover on the far side of the moon later this year.

Despite external constraints when it comes to space cooperation with China, the French side has had a longstanding, close collaboration with China in the field, and achieved a series of successes in the aspects of sharing space orbit data, aero engine design, satellite key component design and production, said Sun Yuming, Minister Counselor for Science and Technology at the Chinese Embassy in France, Science and Technology Daily reported on Tuesday.According to Sun, the two sides will continue to push forward deep cooperation in the domains including space station, lunar and Mars exploration and space science, as well as jointly implement the Paris Agreement."A big China-France space cooperation potential also lies in the building of Moon village, an international program still under discussion," Deng Yulin, an International Academy of Astronautics academician and a professor with the Beijing Institute of Technology who is currently on an academic trip to Paris, told the Global Times. China and France are complimentary to each other in the space exploration domain, with China showing significant strengths in fields including lunar exploration and building of its own space station in the near future, and France excelling in developing certain research payloads, Deng explained.Newspaper headline: China, France to explore space together EU to shun American assault against HuaweiChina, Italy sign BRI MoU to advance connectivityChina's J-10 fighter jet celebrates its birthday amid Pakistani parade Allahu AkbarSurprising discovery
