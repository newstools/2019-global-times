China also has extensive experience in developing drones, so people may see a drone playing similar role on China's future aircraft carriers, the expert predicted.Newspaper headline: Buddy refueling exercise shows aircraft combat capability China develops anti-stealth radarsJF-17 Block 3 jet expected to be fitted with active electronically scanned array radarMass shooting exposes Western flaws Surprising discovery'Super' bloom
