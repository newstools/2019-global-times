Some Chelonian species are thought to be traded through websites illegally, the report said. Ivory products made up the lion's share of online advertisements, followed by hawksbills, tigers, rhinos and whale products, according to the report.Gao Xin, a representative of Sina Weibo, which officially joined the coalition on Wednesday, said that the platform will use online celebrities and stars to spread the word to users, mostly young teenagers, about wildlife conservation.The Chinese coalition began to include foreign internet companies and has cooperated with TRAFFIC, CWCA and WWF since March 2018. It has 32 members as of Wednesday. Steven Broad, the executive director of TRAFFIC, told the Global Times that since suspects will always try to go around the law, the coalition keeps tracking new trends and sites online where wildlife is sold, as well as receives more members from arts collection and antique trading websites. The coalition's goal is to reduce wildlife trafficking online by 80 percent by 2020. However, staff from the coalition told the Global Times that there is a lack of information sharing among coalition members due to different corporate and national policies, which hindered members from working together.
