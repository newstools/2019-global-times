More than 38 percent of the proposals focused on economic issues, such as stabilizing the economy and improving business conditions for the private sector.Wang Haijing, a member of the CPPCC National Committee, said he felt the proposals were more "pragmatic and specific" this year. "With the proposals getting more and more pragmatic, the government's response and implementation of the proposals are also getting better," he told the Global Times on Tuesday.The proposals will be assigned to relevant government agencies and the CPPCC National Committee will oversee the implementation of some  important proposals, the report said.In a speech at the closing ceremony on Wednesday, CPPCC National Committee Chairman Wang Yang called on members to take responsibility. "There are no honorary members, there are only responsible members," he said, calling on members to improve their work."This year, there is a much bigger focus on the quality of the work of [the CPPCC National Committee] members," Yang Yunyan, a member of the CPPCC National Committee, told the Global Times on Wednesday. "The demand [for members] is much higher and more specific."Yang, who is also a deputy governor of Central China's Hubei Province, said that in the past, being a CPPCC National Committee member was more of an honorary position, "but there is a much stronger sense of responsibility and sense of mission."Aside from improving the quality of their proposals, CPPCC National Committee members should also work to rally broader support across the country and among Chinese communities across the world to support the country's economic and social development goals, Wang said.
