However, Ledong eventually concluded that the promotion of blockchain culture would be a better path, Lin Xiaozhang, head of the village, told the Global Times on Thursday.China banned bitcoin trading in September 2017 and shut down  trading platforms. But the government has stressed the importance of developing blockchain technology. Central and local governments have increased support for blockchain over the past two years and have built a good foundation for the technology in China, with more than 40 policies announced in 2018 alone, according to a report released by the China Electronics Standardization Institute (CESI) in December.However, there are still weak spots such as gaps in knowledge about blockchain, shortage of mature technologies, lack of proper standards, the report noted.Ledong seems to have made a certain amount of progress in some areas. About 90 percent of the villagers know about bitcoin and there is more interest in blockchain among young people, Lin said.However, there is still a long way to go before the village can build a complete blockchain industry, which is its long-term goal. "We are at a point where concept verification is transitioning toward exploratory application," Li Ming, director of the Blockchain Research Department at the CESI, told the Global Times. "However, the environment for blockchain still needs further improvement."For Ledong to be a true "blockchain village," it might need more than just theme parks and handrails with blockchain information. Any industrial park needs research and development, talent and promotion, among other things, Li said.
