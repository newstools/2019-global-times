"They are very interesting cultural relics and have distinct characteristics that can be used as creative materials," she said. The memes' designers made the cultural relics move in the images to express certain emotions. For example, the colored pottery figurine waves one of his arms to cheer for users, where the line "please cheer up today" appears.A face made of red pottery about 5,200 years ago is also turned into a laughing face.
