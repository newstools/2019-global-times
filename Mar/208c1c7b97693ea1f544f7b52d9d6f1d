But few of them are aware that they could be illegal.The Global Times reporter discovered many money exchange groups on WeChat, whose rates are lower than bank rates. "There are no service charges," said a Chinese graduate surnamed Zhao who studied at the University of Sheffield. "It was not complicated," Zhao said.Another Chinese student surnamed Chen who graduated from the University of Leeds told the Global Times on Wednesday that he had privately exchanged a total of 200,000 yuan ($29,800) to pound sterling through WeChat.
