The seafood there doesn't taste nearly as good as those from North Korean waters," Zhou said.Dandong's real estate prices rose slight over the past two weeks despite the continued stalemate in summit talks, indicating that locals are still holding out hope of a positive resolution in the future.The average property price of Dandong New City, a district of Dandong which was designed to be a China-North Korean trade hub, reached some 8,000 yuan ($1,193) per square meter, up by about 300 yuan per square meter in the past two weeks, Zhang Xu, a local real estate agent told the Global Times, on Monday.At least five apartments are sold in the New City district per day, and many of the newly built apartment buildings have already sold out, Zhang noted.Business insiders, home buyers and property investors in Dandong are choosing to believe that any "talks are better than no-talk. And talks bring hope closer," said Zhang.Newspaper headline: Hopes for business boom in border city crushed by fruitless Kim-Trump summit Nepal gauges interests in choosing China rail normScholarly article documents Western stereotyping of ChinaChinese-run railway in Ethiopia gives regional development much-needed boost Fire drillUS massage industry needs regulations for developmentFirecracker Run
