Each student's reply would be displayed on a big screen. Mu would invite the students to elaborate, which she said could strengthen students' in-depth understanding of class topics.Eight teacher representatives, including Chen Guo from Fudan University, attended the Monday symposium. Suggestive guidance works better than indoctrination, and teachers should stimulate students' moral emotions, enlighten their ideals as well as guide them to establish correct views of the world, life and values through interaction and frank discussions, said Chen, also a popular ideological and political theory teacher on Chinese social media.   Colleges across China launched reforms in ideological and political education in December 2016 after Xi stressed the importance and clarified the direction of the education in a conference on ideological and political education at colleges. After more than two years, ideological and political education runs well in nationwide colleges, which effectively promoted the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in textbooks and to students, the Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.  New teaching styles involving teacher-student interaction and scene teaching respect students' personal character and activate the students' learning initiative, making ideological and political education more interesting, Xinhua said.A report from China's Ministry of Education showed that among the more than 30,000 college students they surveyed, 91.8 percent like their ideological and political class teachers, Xinhua reported Sunday.Newspaper headline: Xi highlights ideology class China will not pick sides in India-Pakistan disputesF-35 fighter jet plan 'not aimed at China'China-US trade deal must be fair, equal Surprising discovery'Super' bloom
