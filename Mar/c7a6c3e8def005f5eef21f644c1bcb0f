CPPCC members bring proposals for areas they have expertise, including education, technology and economic policies.In 2018, CPPCC National Committee members submitted 5,571 proposals and 4,567 were assigned to 165 responsible government agencies to address, according to Su Hui, vice chairwoman of the CPPCC National Committee. As of February 20, 99.2 percent were resolved, she said in an address at the opening ceremony."With the efforts of all sides, the results of the proposals have been adopted effectively and played an important function of serving policies and pushing for work," she said, adding the proposals were mostly focused on the country's three battles against major risks, poverty and pollution as well as promoting high-quality growth."This year's CPPCC work report was very pragmatic. It includes a very vivid description of specific things. There were no empty words," Xu Ziqiang, a member of the CPPCC National Committee from Central China's Hunan Province, told the Global Times on Sunday after the opening ceremony. "For me, the most important thing is for our proposals to be implemented and take effect."New priorityTo continue to improve the quality of the proposals of CPPCC members and the efficiency of implementing the proposals will be one of the top priorities this year, Wang said.As the country faces challenges, this year's top priority will be helping the government achieve a moderately prosperous society in all aspects - the first centenary goal of the country, he added."At the moment, the task of reaching a moderately prosperous society is so heavy, contradictions, risks and challenges are so many, demands of different interests are so complicated. It is unprecedented," Wang said, adding that all CPPCC members' proposals this year will focus on the CPC and the government's central goals."The basic challenge is implementing the vision laid out in the 19th CPC National Congress, how to transition to high quality growth, how to transition well-being and in the shorter-term challenge is how to maintain macroeconomic stability during that transition," Ben Bingham, China country director at the Asian Development Bank who was invited to observe the CPPCC session, told the Global Times.The Chinese economy continues to face downward pressure and a worsening external environment including an ongoing trade war with the US. Apart from economic woes, the country is also battling pollution and poverty.CPPCC members struck a confident note on Sunday. "I think if we all do our jobs and unite behind the leadership, we will be successful," Wei Shizhong, a member of the CPPCC National Committee from Central China's Henan Province, told the Global Times, "and our job is to offer some suggestions for the country and help better implement these policies."
