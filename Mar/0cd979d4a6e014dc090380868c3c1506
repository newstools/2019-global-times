"Fashion style is an individual choice. Others should not regulate what a delicate style and what manly style is," a netizen wrote."Instead of judging people by their clothing, pay more attention to their sense of responsibility and other qualities," another netizen said.A 25-year-old woman living in Beijing surnamed Meng told the Global Times on Tuesday that she prefers shirts and jeans, "but that does not mean that I am masculine. I prefer them only because they are convenient," she said.
