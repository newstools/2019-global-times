A labor sub-index fell 0.2 points to 107.4 during the final three months of 2018. In this data series, a reading above 100 points to expansion while one below indicates contraction. Saying that he hoped the recent stock market rebound in China could help revive the job market, Yao suggested that the government step up efforts to cut social security contributions by enterprises.The NPC deputy also advised the government to increase unemployment insurance refunds and offer guaranteed and subsidized loans for starting new ventures to reduce labor costs, according to his motions, which were obtained by the Global Times on Monday.The motions to address job-creation troubles among smaller businesses include ramped-up actions to nurture a pool of skilled workers and increase training subsidies for small-scale businesses. Layoffs have hit many companies, especially those in the private sector, Zhou Dewen, director of the Zhejiang Private Investment Enterprise Association, told the Global Times on Monday. This, in addition to a massive number of new university graduates and fresh graduates from specialized secondary schools and vocational training institutes, means increasing job market pressure this year, Zhou said.The government should attach greater importance to the issue with job creation amid continued downward pressure on the Chinese economy, Zhou added.Policy support should be in place for start-ups and companies struggling to stay afloat, as they need to be offered a helping hand. Such moves will help stabilize the job market, he pointed out, adding that employment agencies ought to be given full play to revive jobs.
