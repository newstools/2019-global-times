Their complaint to authorities triggered public outrage, with many of the parents rushing to the school on Wednesday.About 100 people disrupted traffic, seriously disturbed the public order in Wenjiang district where the school is located. Police used tear gas and detained 12 people who hit the police, police said on Sina Weibo.The police said they released 12 of them later that day.An angry parent told the Global Times on Thursday that the elementary school department has suspended classes. The school sent parents a notice to inform them the Wenjiang district education bureau took over the school while local authorities set up an investigation team and would hold a meeting to respond to parents' questions in the school, she said.A parent would be selected as a representative for a dialogue with the team, she said.The food safety scandal has drawn national attention, with the public slamming the school's unscrupulousness and urged authorities to thoroughly investigate the responsible party, including the canteen food supplier, Sichuan Deyu Logistics Management Services Co. Ltd.Deyu's website said that the company serves more than 20 schools and over 100,000 students in Sichuan, arousing public concern over food safety at other schools.Local schools in Sichuan have been self-examining and disciplining over the canteen food materials and supplies, and published the results, according to announcements from the local market regulation bureaus in the province. The district government of Wenjiang said on Weibo on Wednesday that the school canteen had cut ties with Deyu. The 36 students were treated and released from a hospital after the local health bureau assigned doctors to treat them, said the Wenjiang government on Wednesday.According to posts spread on Sina Weibo on Tuesday, the school had allegedly been serving moldy food for a long time, causing students to suffer from gastrointestinal disorders."My niece told us the canteen food smelled bad, but I thought she was just a picky person," the parent said, noting that canteens in the middle and high school departments were also served by Deyu.It was reported that a parent discovered the food quality problem after working undercover for a month at the school canteen after her child suffered long-term loose bowels.Newspaper headline: Authorities launch school food safety investigation China will not pick sides in India-Pakistan disputesF-35 fighter jet plan 'not aimed at China'China-US trade deal must be fair, equal 'Super' bloomFire drill
