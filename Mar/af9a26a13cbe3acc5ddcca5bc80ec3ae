Professor Ren Xiaoping holds a press conference in November 2017, explaining to the media that it is not accurate to call the surgery a "head transplant," and it was only an experiment.

It led to motor recovery in mice, rats, and dogs. "This is currently the best recovery method [for spinal cord injury] internationally," he said.He said now they have finished lab trials and looking for global partners to conduct human trials. "We are currently looking for hospitals that are willing to cooperate with us, [hospitals in] any country will do."Ren and Canavero came under the spotlight in November 2017 after they claimed to have conducted the world's first head transplant on a corpse at a Chinese hospital. Experts around the world raised doubts about the feasibility of head transplants as science has not proven it possible to reconnect the severed nerves in a spinal cord, and the ethical issues that come with it. In their published paper, Ren and Canavero said that they have shown that permanent paralysis after a complete transection of the spinal cord can be prevented in part by immediate, topical application of the polyethylene glycol solution in the region of the spinal cord transection.According to Ren, although spinal-cord recovery is the one of the biggest obstacles for head transplant surgery, this "challenge of the century" is not their plan.Western media always want to hype our experiment by describing it as for "head transplantation," but what we really want to do is just to fix spinal-cord injuries. There has been little progress in treating spinal-cord injuries anywhere in the world, Ren said, noting that their trial shed new light on solving the problem, and has been recognized internationally.
