"The timetable for financial opening is set based on the needs of China's reform and opening-up, so there is relatively less interference for us."Dong of Wuhan University noted that China would likely focus "the breadth and depth" of its financial opening by increasing foreign participation in areas such as stocks and bonds. "We have opened a lot of the area but the scale of foreign capital is still relatively small," Dong said. China should open the financial sector at its own pace and not be affected by foreign pressure, Dong said. "Or it could be very dangerous to the health of our financial system," he said.Pan Gongsheng, a deputy governor of the PBC, noted at the same press briefing on Sunday that foreign capital only makes up 2.7 percent of investment in stocks and 2.3 in bonds."While our stock market and bond market is very attractive to foreign capital, we are still at an early stage of opening and the level of openness is still not high," Pan said.The US, among others, has been pressuring China to open its financial market and has demanded the renminbi not be devalued to offset the impact of the tariffs.PBC chief Yi said Sunday that the two sides have reached consensuses on "key issues" regarding foreign exchange rates and talked about respecting each other's autonomy in setting monetary policy and honoring the commitment made at the G20 such as avoiding a currency devaluation competition."I want to stress that we will never use the foreign exchange rate for competitive purposes or use the foreign exchange rate to increase China's exports or use it as a tool in trade tensions," Yi said.
