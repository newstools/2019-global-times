But like other people, they are free to have their own views, their own ideas. So what we can do is that we can also encourage them to resume discussions with the central government of China."Srikanth Kondapalli, chairman of the Centre for East Asian Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said India is not involved in the power transition within the Dalai Lama's group and the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama exile group or Tibet-separatist forces surrounding the Dalai Lama in India are troubles for India when China and India are having good relationship, but when the China-India relationship is intense, they will become a card that India can play to provoke China, said experts.For instance, in 2017 during the standoff in Doklam, India allowed a Tibetan exile group leader to visit and place the group's flag at the side of Pangong lake, a lake located in the China-India border area with the Line of Actual Control passing through it."Using the Tibetan exile group as a card to provoke China will only damage China-India ties which recovered from the situation in 2017. So, no matter what happens in the future, we sincerely hope India is fully aware of the potential danger that Tibet-separatist forces bring, and treasure the efforts that both sides have made to repair the bilateral ties," Hu said.
