She also said thanks to the persistent and brave South Korean press, the police finally launched the investigation.  Actually, the scandal has rocked the music industry and hit entertainment stocks, which triggered Asian people to urge the retrial of the related sex abuse case of late Korean actress Jang Ja-Yeon in 2009. A total of 675,220 South Korean residents petitioned South Korean government to extend the investigation period of Jang's case, as of press time, as the original term limit of public prosecution was expiring.Jang committed suicide in 2009 at the age of 29, leaving behind notes revealing that she was forced by her agency to have sex with high-profile figures. However, the prosecution did not charge prominent figures whose names appeared in her notes, which prompted criticism from the public."Compared to the outrage on the simmering sex scandal, the chilling truth for the public is the authorities' lack of action," wrote a Korean netizen on Instagram. Stunned by the public pressure, the South Korean government extended the investigation period of Jang's case to May, which a Japanese netizen described on Instagram as "a victory for public opinion."
