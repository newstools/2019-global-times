Iran will defend itself against any military or economic aggression, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday, calling on European states to do more to preserve a nuclear agreement his country signed.Speaking at a news conference in Baghdad with his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed al-Hakim, Zarif said his country wanted to build balanced relations with its Gulf Arab neighbors and that it had proposed signing a non-aggression pact with them."We will defend against any war efforts against Iran, whether it be an economic war or a military one, and we will face these efforts with strength," he said.Strains have increased between Iran and the US, which is a firm backer of Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia, after this month's attack on oil tankers in the Gulf region that Washington has blamed on Iran.Tehran has distanced itself from the bombings, but the US has sent an aircraft carrier and an extra 1,500 troops to the Gulf, sparking concerns about the risks of conflict in a volatile region.Iraq stands with Iran and is willing to act as an intermediary between its neighbor and the US, Hakim said, adding that Baghdad does not believe an "economic blockade" is fruitful, a reference to US sanctions."We are saying very clearly and honestly that we oppose the unilateral actions taken by the United States. We stand with the Islamic Republic of Iran in its position," said Hakim. The United States and Iran are Iraq's two main allies.Washington has been seeking to tighten sanctions against Iran, as relations worsen under President Donald Trump, who last year pulled out of a nuclear agreement his predecessor Barack Obama had signed with Iran alongside other world powers in 2015.
