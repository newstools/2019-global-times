The Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) plans to develop a national database of sex crimes against minors, said a senior SPP prosecutor Monday. The database has been listed in the five-year reform plan of the SPP, said Shi Weizhong, a senior SPP prosecutor, at a press conference. The SPP also plans to introduce a national mechanism that vets civil servants and employees of certain public institutions on whether they have been involved in sex crimes against minors, Shi said. The first provincial database on sex crimes has been established, and the pre-placement vetting of civil servants and employees of certain public institutions, such as teachers, started in Shanghai, according to Shi. Meanwhile, in March central China's Hubei Province adopted a policy requiring employees at departments of education, health, social aid and social welfare and at village and community committees to report their criminal records involving crimes against children.
