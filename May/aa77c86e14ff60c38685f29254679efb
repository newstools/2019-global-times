Private enterprises should shoulder their responsibility as pioneers in China's reform and economic development, a senior executive of a private Chinese energy service company said here on Wednesday. During the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC), the world's largest annual oil and gas trade show, Wang Feng, vice president of Jereh, a global group specializing in oil & gas, power and environmental management, said Chinese private-owned companies such as Jereh should play as a "new force" in the country's economic development. "No matter in terms of innovation or social-economic structure, private enterprises should be pioneers in economic development," he told Xinhua. This year, Chinese participants in OTC include state-run leading companies such as China National Offshore Oil Corporation and China National Petroleum Corporation, as well as private enterprises from across the country. The technical program of the four-day event includes more than 80 technical sessions, industry breakfasts and themed luncheons covering a wide range of topics. This year's new program, Around the World Series, features industry leaders from Australia, Canada, Britain, France, Ghana, Guyana, Israel, Mexico and Norway to discuss new licensing and business opportunities, as well as recently introduced technologies. Founded in 1969, OTC provides a platform for energy professionals to exchange thoughts to advance scientific and technical knowledge on offshore resources and environmental matters. This year's OTC is held in Houston on May 6-9.
