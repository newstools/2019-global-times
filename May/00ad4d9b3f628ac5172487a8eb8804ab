A recent academic report has forecast that China's grain production will increase slightly this year, a situation that one expert attributed to better weather conditions in 2019 as well as the government's plan to increase the cultivation of certain crops. According to a report published by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences on May 13, China's total grain yield will generally be at the same level as in 2018, with mild increases. The report anticipated that China's rice, wheat and maize production would likely reach 210 million tons, 130 million tons and 260 million tons this year. China's supply of soybeans will also increase stably, the report said. China produced about 212 million tons of rice, 131 million tons of wheat and 257 million tons of corn in 2018, according to domestic media reports. Jiao Shanwei, editor-in-chief of cngrain.com, told the Global Times on Monday that weather disasters such as high temperatures, heavy winds and draught were very severe last year, and these conditions cause huge damage to grain production in 2018. This year's weather conditions have been so far much better than in 2018, so grain production is very likely to rebound as a result," Jiao said.Jiao added that the government has made plans to rejuvenate soybean farming, leading to larger areas of soybean planting that would in turn increase production. But Jiao said that the production increase won't be enough to fill the gap in soybean supplies because of falling imports amid the escalating China-US trade war. "I think the government is also learning lessons from the soybean case, that China's agricultural product supply can't be overly reliant upon imports," Jiao said.
