China's top political advisor on Friday stressed efforts to consolidate ethnic unity and promote religious harmony in a national workshop for provincial- and ministerial-level officials. Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, said work related to ethnic and religious affairs is a key issue that must be addressed well in the governance of China. To improve the work, Wang stressed the need to enhance the common awareness of being members of the Chinese nation, increase support for the development of ethnic minority-populated areas, and use the law to safeguard ethnic unity. He also called for efforts to guide the religious sector to work together with the Party and the government and explore the religious doctrines to find contents that are good for social harmony and progress and interpret them in ways that are compatible with China's needs for development and progress and fit the fine traditional Chinese culture. Wang stressed the Party's centralized and unified leadership over the work related to ethnic and religious affairs.
