Canberra has been named the roadkill capital of Australia for the third consecutive year after about 200 collisions between drivers and animals in 12 months.According to data from claims made to insurance company AAMI, the Canberra suburbs of Majura and Fyshwick had the highest number of collisions between drivers and animals in the country, with 98 recorded between March 2018 and February 2019.Nationally, kangaroos accounted for 96 percent of insurance claims involving collision with an animal while wombats and wallabies made up 1 percent each.The kangaroo collisions from the nearby areas of Kambah, Greenway, Deakin, Belconnen and so on brought the total for Canberra, Australia's capital city, to about 232.Wallan, a town 45 km from Melbourne, had the second-highest number of kangaroo collisions with 52, followed by fellow Victorian towns Heathcote and Gisborne with 49 and 41 respectively.Ashleigh Paterson, a spokesperson for AAMI, told Fairfax Media on Thursday that collisions with animals were more common in the winter months."As the days shorten, motorists are sharing the road with animals for longer periods of time as they are most active during dawn and dusk," she said."Simple things such as being aware of your surroundings, driving to the speed limits and being extra vigilant at dawn and dusk can help keep you and our wildlife safe."The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government culls eastern grey kangaroos in parks and grassland around Canberra between May and July every year in order to control the population and prevent them from over-grazing.The government expects that over 4,000 kangaroos will be shot during the 10-week program in 2019, twice as many as in 2018.
