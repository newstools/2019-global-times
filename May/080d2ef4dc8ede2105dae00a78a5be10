Huawei introduced its first 5G foldable phone on February 24 in Barcelona, Spain. In April this year, Samsung followed suit by releasing its foldable phone called Galaxy Fold, but it was soon criticized over defective screen problems including bulges or cracks on the screens. Google is also reported to be working on foldable devices, according to a report by cnet.com on May 7, but the company is not rushing to put any foldable products into the market at the moment, the report said. Wang Yanhui, secretary-general of the Mobile China Alliance, told the Global Times that foldable devices might be the future of digital gadgets."In terms of hardware innovation, there haven't been many breakthroughs except foldable screens," Wang said. "With time there is huge potential in the market. That is why everyone is in the competition and no one wants to be left behind."
