Pakistan on Wednesday summoned Afghan envoy over a cross-border attack by militants from Afghan side of the border, which killed at least three soldiers and injured seven others, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said. A group of 60 to 70 militants from across the border from bases in Afghanistan attacked troops undertaking fencing effort along Pak-Afghan border in Alwara area of North Waziristan tribal district, the Pakistani army said earlier the day. The ministry said in a statement that the Afghan diplomat was called to the ministry and Pakistan's strong protest was lodged over the cross-border terrorist attack in North Waziristan Tuesday night that launched by terrorist groups coming from Afghanistan. "Pakistan military repulsed the attack by these terrorists who after suffering significant casualties fled back to Afghanistan in small groups," the statement said. It added that such provocations are detrimental to peace and stability along Pakistan-Afghanistan border. "The Afghan side was urged to take immediate action against the terrorist elements on their side and ensure effective measures so that such incidents are not repeated in future," it said.
