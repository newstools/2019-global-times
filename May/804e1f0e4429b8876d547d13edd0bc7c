Taiwan is a part of China and Taiwan question is China's internal affairs that brooks no foreign interference, said Wu Qian, a spokesperson with the Ministry of National Defense, on Thursday. Wu made the remarks in response to the United States' recent frequent provocations on Taiwan-related issues, including the passing of the "Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019" by the US House of Representatives. The one-China principle is a universal consensus of the international community and the important political foundation for the China-US relationship, Wu said. The recent moves by the US side have severely damaged the development of the relationships between the two countries and the two militaries, undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, Wu added. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has firm determination, full confidence and sufficient capacity to thwart any separatist activities and safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wu said.
