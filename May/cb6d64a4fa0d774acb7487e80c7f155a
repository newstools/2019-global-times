The leader of Democratic Alliance, South Africa's opposition party, on Friday promised to work with president of the ruling party African National Congress (ANC) for the good of the country. Mmusi Maimane was addressing the media in Pretoria when he made the remarks. When he spoke, the ANC was leading with 57.9 percent of votes and his party was second with 21.34 percent, as 86.58 percent of results have been captured. Maimane said he will respect the will of the people, adding whoever wins should deliver what the people want. "I will congratulate him (ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa). He ran a powerful campaign like we did. I want to say Ramaphosa you have to uphold the Constitution, do things that make our citizens be able to create wealth. You have to fight corruption and build a non-racial South Africa then you have my support. This is all about the future of this country," said Maimane. He warned that if Ramaphosa put his party ANC before the people, they will resist. Maimane said he is concerned that it was possible for some people to vote twice. He said they held some meetings and agreed that an audit be done to check what really transpired.
