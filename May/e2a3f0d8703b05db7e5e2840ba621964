Venezuela will prosecute seven lawmakers who backed last week's failed coup orchestrated by opposition leader Juan Guaido, the country's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday, as Washington removed sanctions against Caracas' sacked spy chief for backing the revolt.The court, which announced the ruling in a statement, said it asked Attorney General Tarek William Saab to handle the "criminal investigation" into opposition deputies for "high treason" and "conspiracy."Soon after the announcement, the Constituent Assembly stripped the seven lawmakers of their parliamentary immunity."What comes now? A trial," said Constituent Assembly speaker Diosdado Cabello, the government's second most powerful figure after President Nicolas Maduro.Cabello added that three unnamed other lawmakers had been identified and would undergo the same process.The list includes Henry Ramos Allup, the former speaker of the opposition-controlled National Assembly.In Washington, US Vice President Mike Pence kept up the pressure on President Nicolas Maduro's government by announcing that sanctions against his sacked intelligence chief General Christopher Figuera were being lifted.Pence, speaking at the State Department, said he hoped that Figuera's defection would inspire other senior Venezuelans to break ranks with Maduro.Washington "will consider sanctions relief for all those who step up for the constitution and support the rule of law," Pence said."I hope the actions our nation is taking today will encourage others to follow the example of General Cristopher Figuera."However, Mexico rejected that approach, as well as Washington's refrain that "all options are on the table" to remove Maduro from power - a euphemism understood as hinting to military intervention.Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard warned that pursuing a military intervention would be a "big mistake."
