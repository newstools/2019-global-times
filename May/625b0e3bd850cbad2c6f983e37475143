Prince Hisahito along with his peers returned to his school on Monday for regular classes following a temporary suspension after a man trespassed on the premises and left knives on the young prince's desk last month. Classes had been halted at Ochanomizu University Junior High School in Tokyo's Bunkyo Ward following the incident which occurred on April 26. The incident occurred as Japan was preparing to celebrate the ascension of Emperor Naruhito following the abdication of Emperor Emeritus Akihito. The school held a parents' meeting after the potentially deadly incident and, after apologizing to parents for the school's lax security protocols, it vowed to beef-up its systems and practices to avoid such an incident from happening again, local media reported. The school said it had increased the number of security guards monitoring outside access points and those on patrol, as well as pledged to hold more safety drills to instruct the teachers and children on what to do in the event an intruder enters the building again.
