"Based on the US' performance in previous rounds of talks, we must emphasize two points: stand by your principles and keep your promises.""China has become more cautious about further trade talks after the 11th round in Washington, which turned out to be hugely frustrating, denting mutual trust and adding uncertainty," Song Guoyou, director of Fudan University's Center for Economic Diplomacy, told the Global Times on Thursday.China-US trade negotiations have entered a very "sensitive and vulnerable" moment, said Song.The US raised tariffs on China's imports worth $200 billion on May 10. On Monday, China struck back, announcing duties of between 5 percent and 25 percent on more than 5,100 products from the US worth $ 60 billion.Starting on June 1, China will impose an additional tariff of 25 percent on 2,493 items such as liquefied natural gas and 20 percent on 1,078 items, including fruit and chemicals, starting June 1, the Customs Tariff Commission under the State Council, China's cabinet, said in a statement."The war has literally expanded, and it is much different from the previous rounds of negotiations in nature," Song added.Â If the US does not stop its wrongdoing in imposing unilateral tariff increases, China must take necessary countermeasures, said Gao.The MOFCOM reiterated China's firm stance on the three key concerns on trade talks - the US must remove all the additional tariffs imposed on China, the targets set by the US for Chinese purchases should be in line with China's true demand, and the text of a deal should be balanced and acceptable."China will definitely not compromise on the core issues," Gao said.When asked if US companies operating in China will be targeted amid the escalating trade war, Gao said that the interests of foreign companies operating in China will continue to be protected by the Chinese government.Newspaper headline: Firm stance on talks, no compromise on core issues: MOFCOM Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Actress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame starUnrealistic expectations thwart Chinese job recruitersDelegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los Angeles
