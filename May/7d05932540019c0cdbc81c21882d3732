Heavy rains and strong winds will continue across Sri Lanka in the coming days as a severe cyclonic storm, named Fani, is moving away from the island country, the Meteorology Department said in its latest weather update on Thursday. The department said the extremely severe cyclonic storm was located about 880 km northeast of Jaffna, in the north, and was likely to move north-northeastwards while moving away from the island. While the effect will gradually reduce, strong winds up to 60 km per hour can be expected over the island along with heavy rains, particularly in the central hilly areas, northern, north central, north-western and southern provinces and in the Trincomalee district, in the east. General public, naval and fishing communities are requested to be cautious, the Meteorology Department said.
