Swedish prosecutors said Monday they were reopening a 2010 rape investigation against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, hoping to bring him to justice before the statute of limitations expires in August 2020.The 47-year-old has claimed the Swedish allegations were a pretext to transfer him to the US, where he fears prosecution over the release by WikiLeaks of millions of classified documents."I have today decided to reopen the investigation... There is still probable cause to suspect that Mr Assange committed rape," the deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, told reporters."The previous decision [in May 2017] to close the investigation was not based on difficulties related to evidence, but on difficulties that blocked the investigation."Assange, who holed himself up in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London for seven years, was arrested on April 11 after Ecuador gave him up.A London court sentenced him on May 1 to 50 weeks in jail for breaching the BritishÂ order."Now that he has left Ecuador's embassy, the conditions in the case have changed and I am of the opinion that the conditions are in place once again to pursue the case," the prosecutor said.Persson said she hoped Assange could be questioned again in the case. She said he would soon ask a Swedish court to remand him in custody in absentia, and a European arrest warrant would be issued.
