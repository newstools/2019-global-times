Kazakh Ambassador to China Shakhrat Nuryshev Photo: Yao Lijuan/GTRelations between China and Kazakhstan will definitely be further strengthened regardless of the election's outcome, Kazakh Ambassador to China Shakhrat Nuryshev said at a press conference on Tuesday, as the Central Asian country is about to elect a new president in 30 years next month."What I want to emphasize is that [Nursultan] Nazarbayev's resignation as president will in no way affect ties between Kazakhstan and China. Nazarbayev is still the first president, the chairman of the ruling Nur Otan Party and head of the Security Council. Kazakhstan will maintain its diplomatic policy with all partner countries," Nuryshev said.He added that joint projects will be further promoted, in response to the Global Times' question on the Silk Road Economic Belt cooperation.Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who became Kazakh president following Nazarbayev's resignation in March, announced in April that a snap presidential election would be held on June 9.The country's Central Election Commission registered seven candidates earlier this month, including Tokayev, who was nominated by the ruling Nur Otan Party after Nazarbayev endorsed him.Nuryshev said the election is expected to be the most competitive one in the country, and will be fair and open with over 1,000 international observers monitoring the process.
