Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza on Tuesday urged Washington to cease meddling in his country's internal affairs and to overcome the differences between the two countries through diplomacy.During a speech at the XVIII Political Council of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) taking place in Havana, Arreaza reiterated Caracas' will to live in peace without threats from the US government."We call on the United States to apply diplomacy, dialogue, and understanding, respect each other, and end the military threat, the arrogance, and the economic blockade," said Arreaza.The senior official said domestic issues should be solved by the Venezuelan people and the political forces in the South American nation, without foreign interference.He thanked Mexico, Uruguay and some Caribbean nations for initiating dialogue between the Venezuelan government and the local opposition, and condemned the sanctions imposed by Washington against his country, especially the "financial persecution" which impedes the country from buying goods and medicine abroad.This ALBA meeting is of "vital importance" due to US threats against regional peace and security, as well as solidarity with Caracas, he said.During the meeting, several nations including Cuba, Bolivia, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Suriname expressed their opposition to threats of foreign military intervention in Caracas and called for dialogue to resolve the political crisis in the South American nation.Founded initially by Cuba and Venezuela in 2004, the ALBA bloc aims to reduce Latin America's reliance on Western aid by promoting intra-regional alliances and cooperation in key sectors such as energy and trade.
