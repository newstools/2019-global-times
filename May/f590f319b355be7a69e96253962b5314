Cuba and Vietnam agreed to strengthen bilateral ties by signing a joint plan of political consultations for the 2020-2022 period on Monday. The document was signed by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and visiting Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, with the goal of "strengthening political dialogue on issues of bilateral and multilateral interest." Both countries constantly exchange experiences on building socialist societies according to their own characteristics and internal dynamics said Rodriguez said before the signing. "We will commemorate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2020 and the economic, commercial and investment links are going very well and have a promising future," said Rodriguez. "I believe the new generations have the responsibility to continue cultivating these ties and further strengthen them," Pham said. To boost "fraternal and historic bonds" between the two countries, Pham arrived in the Caribbean nation on Sunday for a three-day official visit and is expected to meet other Cuban officials including President Miguel Diaz-Canel.
