Three militants were killed and a trooper wounded on Friday in a fierce gunfight with government forces in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said. The gunfight between militants and government forces broke out at village Aadkhara, Imam Sahab of Shopian district, about 58 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. "A gunfight broke out this morning between militants and joint contingents of army and police here. The militants present inside a house fired upon search party, which was retaliated by it resulting into a stand-off," a police official posted in Shopian told Xinhua. Police said the identity of slain militants was being ascertained. However, local media reports said the three were local cadres of region's indigenous militant outfit, Hizbul Mujahideen. According to police, the operation in the area was launched on specific intelligence information suggesting presence of militants. Authorities have suspended mobile internet service in the districts, south of Srinagar, in the wake of the gunfight. Locals said clashes broke out between youth and government forces in the area following the killing of three militants in the gunfight.
