A Chinese performing arts show was held Friday at US California State University, Los Angeles to commemorate the achievement of Chinese scientist Rongxiang Xu in advancing regenerative life science. The show, themed "the Light of Regeneration," also celebrated the commencement of Class 2019 of Rongxiang Xu College of Health and Human Services. The arts show was performed by a group of artists from China and drew about 2,000 attendees, including local officials, community leaders and university personnel. "It is significant to bring Chinese culture to the campus named after a Chinese doctor," said Li Li, chairman of the National Rongxiang Xu Foundation, adding that over 2000 students graduate from the college every year. In April 2017, the university officially named the college after Dr. Xu in recognition of his achievement in the field of regenerative medicine, marking the first named college in the university's history of over 70 years. Dr. Xu, founder of Mebo International Group, developed the Moist Exposed Burn Therapy, which has been regarded as a revolutionary regenerative treatment for burns. He passed away in 2015.
