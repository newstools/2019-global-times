Photo: Xinhuad Filipinos headed to the polls on Monday in a vote that is expected to strengthen President Rodrigo Duterte's grip on power.More than 18,000 positions are at stake, including half of the seats in the upper house Senate, which has served as a bulwark against some of Duterte's most controversial policies.Voters crowded voting centers in the capital Manila even ahead of polls opening at 6:00 am in an election where some 61 million are registered to cast ballots."I voted for many of the candidates endorsed by President Duterte because his government is doing its job," said Myrna Cruz, 51. "I support their programs, including the anti-drug campaign... but I wish the bloodshed would stop," she added, echoing many Filipinos' nuanced backing of the crackdown. Winning a Senate majority, something that independent national surveys indicate is well within reach, would give Duterte legislative backing for his anti-crime proposals and his plan to rewrite the constitution.The results for municipal and city mayors and councils are expected within hours of polls closing at 6 pm Monday, with winners for the Senate and congressional seats likely to be declared from Friday.At least three explosions rocked city of Cotabato and neighboring Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines a few hours before the national midterm election, military and police authorities said on Monday.Lieutenant Teofisto Ferrer of the Cotabato City police said the first explosion occurred around 10:15 pm local time Sunday night just outside the Cotabato City hall compound.Ferrer said the explosion was caused by a mortar fired by a still unknown suspect using a grenade launcher.The second explosion happened around 1 am local time on Monday when a fragmentation grenade exploded through a municipal hall in Datu Odin Sinsuat town in Maguindanao province.Several hours later, an explosion, caused by a still undetermined type of explosive, was recorded also in Datu Odin Sinsuat town of Maguindanao around 7:20 am local time, according to Noel Detoyato, Public Affairs chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.No one was killed or injured in all the incidents until press time.
