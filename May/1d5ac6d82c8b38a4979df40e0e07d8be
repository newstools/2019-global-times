It will be the first direct flight to link the two cities, according to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. The flight will be operated by South African Airways and will shorten the travel time to 13 hours and 40 minutes. Flying three times a week, the outbound flight will leave Guangzhou at 10:15 p.m. every Monday, Thursday and Saturday and arrive in Johannesburg at 5:30 a.m. local time the next day.
