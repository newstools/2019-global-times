The gender of the panda remains unknown. It was captured by an infrared camera located 2,000-meters above sea level in the area, the reserve said.It is the first case of wild pandas which go completely albefactist, said Li Sheng, an expert from the School of Life Sciences at Peking University. He said this shows albefaction genes exist in giant pandas.Li noted that pictures show the panda is strong and walks steadily, an indication that the gene mutation did not affect the panda's health. Duan Zhaogang, head of the Wolong reserve, told media that they will increase the number of infrared cameras in the reserve to carefully monitor the panda's life and activities.Global Times Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
