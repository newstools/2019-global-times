Teleplays should carry forward the core socialist values, focus on themes of realizing the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and on the great achievements made by the people under the guidance of the Communist Party of China, the administration said.Teleplays should also be people-oriented, show Chinese people's lives and try to find new stories with a humanist spirit, according to the release.Industry observers said most of the teleplays reflect the key events in history and hail the development of the nation.  Some of the examples are Jiutianlanyue, a TV series that hails China's space industry development, The Bridge, which depicts stories related to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, Go For Gold, which tells the story of table tennis players who earn honor for the country and Waijiaofengyun, a TV series that tells how Chinese diplomats, such as Zhou Enlai, made breakthroughs for China on the international stage.Many mainstream teleplays have become increasingly popular among Chinese people in recent years since the push for positive energy in society and love for the nation, Shi Wenxue, a Beijing-based film observer, told the Global Times.Like a Flowing River tells the life stories of several young men living in the 1970s and reflects on the history of China's opening-up policy. It was streamed more than 5 billion times and is highly rated on China's movie review site Douban, xinhuanet.com reported. Zhang Peng, a researcher at Nanjing University's National Research Center of Cultural Industries, told the Global Times that the NRTA's plan will encourage more original productions of realistically themed TV series. Chinese producers were reluctant to make such series due to high costs, and they got used to borrowing stories from historical works.  However, teleplays like Like a Flowing River have gained in popularity among people born in the late 1990s since the lead characters pursue dreams and contribute to the country, Zhang said. Supporting original realistically themed TV series will also support domestically made teleplays and help the development of the industry, which will increase China's competitiveness, analysts said. Newspaper headline: Model teleplays to carry right values Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Actress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame starUnrealistic expectations thwart Chinese job recruitersDelegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los Angeles
