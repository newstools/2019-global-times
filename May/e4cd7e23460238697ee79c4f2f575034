Illustrations: Luo Xuan/GTThe National College Entrance Examination, commonly known as gaokao, is a life-changing event for most Chinese teenagers. It's so significant that many parents believe it bears their whole families' entire future. Due to provincial differences in terms of examinee numbers, educational resources, and university admission quotas, students in each province face different levels of competition. Recently, a new social group has since emerged - gaokao migrants. Some parents help their children acquire residence in provinces with greater chances to get admitted to top universities. Earlier in May, 32 candidates of this year's gaokao were reported to be "migrants" moving from North China's Hebei Province to Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province. They are accused of occupying Shenzhen's resources and opportunities, prompting outrage from local parents and students. As a result, Shenzhen's educational authority disqualified them from the examination on May 12. The students are seeking a better future, but are they taking others' opportunity as a stepping-stone at the same time?
