Have it explained to them in person, see the tailor, have his measurements taken, be told a story," Niccolo Ricci, the company's CEO, told AFP at the preview this week."He wants to be pampered for an hour," he said."Sometimes we have superstitious customers who want trousers, a suit, shirts for example for important appointments, and given the extremely tight deadlines they give us to deliver the clothes, they send their private plane to get them on time."Whether hankering after a 5,050 euro ($5,640) suede jacket or a 1,600 euro silk-and-crocodile baseball cap, the typical client is an alpha-male, preferably an outdoorsy type with "a love of antique art," according to Stefano Ricci."The Ricci man loves the mountains, the woods, dogs and - I'm not afraid to say it - hunting," he said.The bearded designer, 67, a keen hunter himself, says his passion for high-end tailoring is "a virus.""When it gets hold of you, you produce more, more, more, until you say 'what the heck can I invent now to better this?'"His latest challenge? "Creating a material which has a compact structure but is at the same time extremely soft... and luminous, not like polished glass but like the skin of a beautiful young girl."Focusing on the richest segment of society in emerging markets like Russia, China and the Middle East - the brand is about to open a shop in Turkmenistan - has shielded it from factors weighing on sales at other luxury houses."We've found there is no price limit if the customer finds himself with a quality product," Niccolo Ricci said."So even for a suit that costs 25,000 euros, if the customer understands the work that has been done on it, the quality of the fabric, our commitment to sourcing quality raw materials for our exclusive collections, then the customer is on board."The 2018 financial year closed with a turnover of 150 million, and the company registered a 5 percent growth in the first quarter of this year "despite difficulties such as the tariffs war between the US and China, [and] Brexit or no Brexit.""I have been lucky enough to do something I love, to work with my wife, my family, and I've now passed the baton to my sons," Stefano Ricci says as he stands at the top of a vast marble staircase leading to the royal apartments."I design the collections a bit, I give guidelines, I participate in the process, but I'm much more relaxed now."Among the highlights of his career is a white silk vestment made for Pope Francis in 2015."I dressed the pope! I can't do better than that, it's the truth," he laughs. "I couldn't hope for more."Newspaper headline: ‘King for a Day’ Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
