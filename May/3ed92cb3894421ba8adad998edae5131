Facing growing hostility from the United States, the Cuban government on Monday reaffirmed its support to foreign companies operating businesses and investments on the island. Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment, Rodrigo Malmierca, said in his Twitter account that Havana will continue to defend foreign investments for the national development. Cuba will defend its sovereignty and support foreign companies with business here, under our new Constitution and laws, said Malmierca. Washington recently activated Title III of the Helms-Burton Act, amid moves to tighten sanctions against Havana. The Title III of the Helms-Burton Act allows for lawsuits to be filed in US courts against companies operating on property that the Cuban government seized after the year 1959. It had been suspended by every US president since 1996. The Cuban government has reiterated on several occasions that foreign companies have total legal security, under the protection of the Law 118 of Foreign Investment which defends mutually advantageous investments. Dozens of economies including the European Union have expressed their opposition to the US move, say it runs contrary to international law and penalize trade and investments from other countries with Cuba.
