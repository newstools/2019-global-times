who won the Palme d'Or 25 years ago for Pulp Fiction - collected the Palm Dog prize Friday for Cannes' best canine performance, joking, "At least I do not go home empty-handed." The Camera d'Or for best first feature film went to Guatemala's Cesar Diaz for Our Mothers, a drama about those "disappeared" during the country's brutal civil war.The jury gave a special mention to Palestinian filmmaker Elia Suleiman's It Must Be Heaven about the experiences of an exile who goes on a meandering odyssey from his hometown of Nazareth to the streets of Paris and New York.This year's jury president, Oscar-winning Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu of Birdman and The Revenant fame, said they selected films among the 21 contenders that tapped into the zeitgeist of a fraught era."These artists are visionaries who are... expressing those worries and frustrations, those nightmares," he said."Cinema now has the urgency of social consciousness expressed by people around the world."'Devastating electric shock'Parasite tells the story of a young man living in a squalid apartment with his family who is struggling in Seoul's gig economy.Without formal qualifications, he charms his way into a job with a wealthy family, tutoring their precocious daughter in English.Soon the tutor's parents and sister also manage to insinuate themselves into the household of the blithely privileged clan living in a luxury home high above the flood plain.Variety critic Jessica Kiang called the film "roaringly furious.""Parasite is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage," she said.US movie website Indiewire called it a "brilliant and devastating electric shock of economic anxiety" and a "compassionate parable about how society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people."Newspaper headline: ‘Crazy about cinema’ Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
