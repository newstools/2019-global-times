Chinese tiles manufacturing firm KEDA Ceramics Ltd on Friday launched a water supply project to help communities in Kajiado county in southwestern Kenya. Wu Peng, Chinese ambassador to Kenya, said at the launching ceremony that the project, which was funded by KEDA Ceramics as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR), will boost Sino-Kenyan relations. "The embassy appreciates such CSR projects and hopes KEDA and other Chinese companies do more in the future, not only transferring technology and development opportunity to this country but also passing friendship from Chinese business community to the local people," Wu said. Martin Moshisho, deputy governor of Kajiado County, said that the water project comes at an opportune time because the county is water scarce as only 36 percent of its residents have access to clean water. Moshisho urged the locals to reciprocate with good deeds toward the company which has uplifted the lives of many people. He said that many Chinese companies have set up in Kajiado County and have created hundreds of job opportunities both directly and indirectly. KEDA Ceramics is one of the biggest Chinese manufacturing projects in Kenya, with a total investment of up to 8 billion Kenyan shillings (80 million US dollars).
