Lithuanians began voting on Sunday for a new president in a tight race dominated by concerns over income inequality and poverty in the Baltic state boasting some of the eurozone's strongest growth.Nine candidates are vying to replace two-term independent incumbent Dalia Grybauskaite, but surveys suggest only three stand a chance of making it to an expected May 26 runoff that would coincide with European Parliament elections.Center-left Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis, conservative ex-finance minister Ingrida Simonyte and independent economist Gitanas Nauseda lead the pack.The main center-right contender Simonyte is popular with wealthy, educated urban voters while Skvernelis' populist approach resonates with the rural poor. Nauseda seeks to appeal across the rich-poor divide in the former Soviet republic of 2.8 million people.It is struggling with a sharp decline in population owing to mass emigration to Western Europe by people seeking a better life.Around a quarter of Lithuanians live below the poverty line, which is about 300 euros ($340) per month."Citizens are thirsty for social justice and seek a candidate who can bridge existing social polarization," Donatas Puslys from the Vilnius Policy Analysis Institute told AFP.Robust annual wage growth of around 10 percent has raised the average gross monthly salary to 970 euros but poverty and income inequality remain among the highest in the EU, largely due to weak progressive taxation.Unemployment rate stood at 6.5 percent in the first quarter of 2019, and the economy is forecast to grow by 2.7 ­percent this year, well above an average of 1.1 percent in the 19-member eurozone.Brussels has urged Vilnius to use solid growth fuelled mostly by consumption to broaden its tax base and spend more on social policies.
