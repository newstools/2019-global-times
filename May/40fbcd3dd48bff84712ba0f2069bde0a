Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on Wednesday that unilateral sanctions cannot bring positive effects for crises, referring to US sanctions against Iran. "In Qatar, we believe crises must be solved through dialogue and dialogue only," said Sheikh Mohammed in statements during a press conference in the capital Doha. Washington's decision not to extend sanction waivers for Iran's oil exports would harm countries that rely on the supplies, the Qatari top diplomat said. "The sanctions should not be extended because they have an adverse impact on countries benefitting from Iranian oil," he noted. The foreign minister of US-allied Qatar urged the United States and Iran to sit at a negotiating table and work out sustainable solutions for the crisis, as the region "can't endure further crises." The United States has decided to end six months of waivers for Iran's major customers to import limited volumes, demanding they stop their purchases by May 2 or face the prospect of sanctions.
