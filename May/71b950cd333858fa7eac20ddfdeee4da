Researchers of Amir Kabir University of Technology achieved the technical knowledge of making activated carbon from cotton wastes.Since earlier in the past, textile has been used for producing all kinds of cloths.Despite development in production and consumption of various kinds of artificial fibers, cotton fibers have not lost their fame in textile industry yet.Thanks to the fact that major part of textile wastes has been made of cellulose fiber, they can be a source for producing valuable goods such as activated carbons.Activated carbon, also called activated charcoal, is a form of carbon processed to have small, low-volume pores that increase the surface area available for adsorption or chemical reactions. Activated is sometimes substituted with active.Use of cotton wastes which are created in the various processes of the cotton textile production line is one of the main goals of the Iranian researchers' project.Amirkabir University of Technology, formerly called the Tehran Polytechnic, is a public research university located in Tehran, Iran. AUT was the first established technical university in Iran, and is referred to as the 'Mother of Engineering Universities'.
