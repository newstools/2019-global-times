The ninth Ningxia Traditional Ethnic Minorities Sports Games started Thursday in Yinchuan, the capital city of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Over 2,100 athletes from nine delegations across the region will compete or perform in the five-day event. There will be 14 sports and 49 events in the games including Huapao (ethnic-style rugby), martial arts, stilt race, shuttlecock kicking and other traditional sports events. The ethnic games are unique in that they put cultural exchanges and mutual understanding ahead of games results. For many participants, this year's game is also a preliminary contest for the 11th Chinese Ethnic Games, which will be held in September in Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province. The first traditional such event in Ningxia was held in 1986.
