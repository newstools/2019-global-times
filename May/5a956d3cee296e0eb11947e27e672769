US President Donald Trump's claim that China broke a trade deal is an attempt to muddy the waters and shift blame, and it was the US' maximum pressure that led to there being no deal in the latest trade talks, China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday."The primary cause of failing to reach a deal in the 11th round of China-US trade negotiations was the US' attempt to pursue its unreasonable interests via extreme pressure on China, which does not work," spokesperson Lu Kang told a regular briefing on Monday.The US' attempt to shift blame and muddy the waters after eliciting doubt in the nation and causing market fluctuations is also in vain, said Lu.According to Fox News on Sunday (US time), Trump said that the US and China "had a very strong deal, we had a good deal, and they changed it.""I don't know what the 'deal' refers to, as claimed by the US. The US might have always had a 'deal' that it wishes for, but it is definitely not the version that China agreed on," Lu said.China reiterates that the only right track features mutual respect, equality and a win-win outcome in embracing prospects for bilateral trade talks."It is obvious to the international community that China held a sincere and constructive attitude in the recent trade negations," the spokesperson noted.
