The 52nd annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Board of Governors kicked off here on Wednesday with the participation of finance ministers, central bank governors, government officials, private sector representatives, development partners and media from Asia and the Pacific region. The theme for the five-day event is "Prosperity Through Unity." Among the issues to be discussed at the meeting are sustainable tourism and its potential to boost national and regional development efforts, the role of private sector financing for disaster risk management and climate resilience, and the importance of actions to improve ocean health. There will also be discussions on ways to respond to heightening global economic uncertainty, the role of digital technologies for financial inclusion, and new tools for sustainable infrastructure development, among others. Fiji is the first Pacific island nation to host such a conference and this provides the participants an opportunity to discuss important and pressing development issues facing Asia and the Pacific region.
