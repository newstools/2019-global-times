Some US officials have accused China on Tibet's religious, cultural and other policies, and criticized China for banning them from visiting the region. Even if some US politicians use the opportunity to attack China on its Tibet policies, China would not care as the overall situation and future development of Tibet are in the hands of the Chinese people and could not be shaken by outside forces, Zhu said.Lu said at a press conference in December  2018 that nearly 40,000 US people have visited Tibet since 2015.
