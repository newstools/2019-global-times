The European Union (EU) Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said here on Friday that the bloc is prepared to negotiate a limited trade deal with the United States including cars. "We note that US postpones decision on car tariffs for 180 days. But we completely reject the notion that our car exports are a national security threat," wrote Malmstrom in a twitter message. The EU is prepared to negotiate a limited trade agreement with the US including cars, she added. "Will discuss with USTR (Trade Representative Robert) Lighthizer next week in Paris and Trade Ministers on 27 May," tweeted the trade chief. The US Department of Commerce submitted to President Donald Trump a report related to the car imports probe in mid-February. Trump said days after receiving the document that imposing the auto tariffs remains an option. Trump had 90 days since the submission of the report to decide whether to implement those punitive tariffs. On Friday, the Trump administration postponed the auto tariffs decision for another 180 days for agreements to be reached.
