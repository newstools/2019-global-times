A total of 5,750 people have been prosecuted for school bullying since the start of 2018, according to an official with the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP). Meanwhile, 3,407 people had their arrest formally approved by Chinese procuratorates, said Shi Weizhong, chief of a department for juvenile prosecution with the SPP, at a press conference Monday on the protection of juveniles ahead of Children's Day. Procuratorates across the country have played an active role working against school bullying, while giving full play to procuratorial functions in efforts to make campuses safer, Shi said. Referring to four instructive cases on school violence released by the SPP last December, he said that juveniles could resort to legal defense when facing school bullying, and that in accordance with law anyone could intervene for the protection of juveniles. Procuratorates have also helped the improvement of safety management mechanisms for schools, having released 3,472 suggestions on campus security since the start of 2018, according to Shi. Moreover, prosecutors have been participating in developing rule of law in schools, aiming to improve awareness of rule of law among teachers and students, with more than 17,300 prosecutors currently serving as vice principals in charge of security issues at schools nationwide, 3,096 of whom are chief prosecutors. Procuratorial organizations around the country have delivered more than 51,600 lectures on the rule of law at schools since last year, covering 57,000 schools with 38 million teachers and students and receiving positive feedback, according to Shi.
