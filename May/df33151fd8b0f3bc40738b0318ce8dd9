China will raise the reimbursement rate of the country's serious disease insurance scheme to 60 percent this year, up 10 percentage points, authorities said. The National Healthcare Security Administration and the Ministry of Finance have jointly issued a circular stating that government subsidies for basic medical insurance for rural and non-working urban residents will be increased by 30 yuan to reach no less than 520 yuan (about $76.6 dollars) per capita annually. Half of the increased subsidies will be used for serious illness insurance, said the circular, adding that poverty-stricken populations will be prioritized. Premium paid by the insured will also be increased by 30 yuan. The circular called for efforts to raise the reimbursement rate for inpatient expenses and to include outpatient medicines for high blood pressure and diabetes into the medical insurance reimbursement list. It also required improved policies and standardized management regarding serious disease insurance. As of the end of 2018, the country's serious disease insurance program was covering about 1.05 billion people.
