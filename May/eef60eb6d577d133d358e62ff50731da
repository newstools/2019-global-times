Some of the proposals are being viewed in China as political rather than technological.The Prague 5G Security Conference was obviously limited to a small circle, and the so-called Prague proposals only represent the views of a handful of countries, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told a press conference on Monday.The drafting of 5G-related rules and standards should draw widely on views from all parties whose interests are involved and be discussed through an open, inclusive multilateral process under a representative and authoritative framework, Geng said.He noted that such efforts aim to create an unbiased competitive environment for enterprises from around the world to participate in 5G construction and to pursue reciprocal benefits.5G is a cutting-edge technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is related to the global economic growth, the interests of countries around the world and the progress of human civilization, Geng said.Given the current context of globalization, the development and the use of 5G rely on exchange and cooperation among countries from across the world, and it is an innovation of the international community, the spokesperson said."It will not be conducive to 5G growth to involve political factors with the development, use and cooperation of the technology, politicizing related issues and adopting biased conducts," Geng said, noting that such actions also go against the principle of fair competition and are not in line with the common interests of the international community.China will strengthen technological exchange and cooperation with all parties based on the principle of achieving shared benefits through extensive consultation and joint contribution, and it will seize the great development opportunity brought about by the new round of technological revolution to make a positive contribution to the promotion of the well-being of mankind, according to Geng.Newspaper headline: Prague 5G proposals only represent few countries' views: official Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
