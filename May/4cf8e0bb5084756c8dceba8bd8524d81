We are confident," an ECA statement quoted Haddad as saying.The iconic hall was built between 1959 and 1961 and inaugurated on February 26, 1961 by Ethiopia's former Emperor Haileselassie, who is considered as one of the founding fathers of the African Union, the former OAU.The complete renovation of Africa Hall main building embraces various works that include surrounding landscape works, a new Visitor Entry Building, upgrading the ECA compound perimeter's wall, a new visitor car park and road-works external to the ECA compound, it was noted.Alem Kiros, Director and Legal Representative for Africa Hall Projects FZE, said that the restoration work is a "great opportunity" that followed two and a half years of negotiations."The project will be delivered up to expectation and even beyond with the expertise of the contractors who have special skills with such levels of renovation," Kiros said.The ECA had previously indicated that the renovation project, when completed, aims to transform Africa Hall into a rejuvenated facility, complying with the highest international standards for conference facilities.As part of preserving and restoring the historical and cultural values embedded in its architecture, the project also include a permanent exhibition to turn historic hall into one of the leading tourist destinations in Addis Ababa and highlight its significant role in the UN and in modern African history, according to the ECA.George Ogboro, Chief of Supply Chain Management Section at the ECA, said that the project "is a major milestone not only for the contractor but also for Africa as a whole. African countries will be proud of the hall even more when the modernization project is completed."Ogboro also stressed the ECA's "maximum support" towards the successful completion of the renovation work.
