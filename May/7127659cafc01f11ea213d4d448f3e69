One South Korean navy sailor was dead and four others were injured Friday morning in a ceremony to welcome the return of a destroyer from an overseas mission, according to local media reports. A rope connecting the 4,400-ton Choi Young destroyer to the dock was snapped for an unidentified reason during the ceremony held at a naval base in the southern port of Jinhae at about 10:15 a.m. local time (0115 GMT). The 22-year-old sailor, set to be discharged from the military service about a month later, died after the rope struck him on the face. Three other sailors and one chief petty officer were wounded, but their injuries were not life-threatening. The accident occurred while hailing the return of the destroyer, which had operated for about six months in waters off Somalia to escort ships and conduct an anti-piracy operation. The military investigative body was investigating the cause of the incident.
