Ukraine's president-elect Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday met with Chinese Ambassador to Ukraine Du Wei in Kiev to discuss bilateral cooperation. During the talks, Zelensky said that he attaches particular importance to Ukraine's relations with China and wants to learn from China's success of development. Zelensky said cooperation between the two countries has great prospects, since Ukraine has a number of advantages -- a favorable geographical position, rich resources and a large number of highly qualified personnel. After assuming the office, the president-elect pledged to take all necessary measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all foreign investors including the Chinese investors. Zelensky called on Chinese businessmen to invest more actively in the construction of factories in Ukraine and develop cooperation in such areas as deep processing of agricultural products, information technology, green energy, digitalization and others. For his part, Du said that China and Ukraine have been developing friendly relations and cooperating with each other under the Belt and Road Initiative. Du hopes that cooperation between the two countries would achieve new breakthroughs and tremendous success during the presidential tenure of Zelensky. Zelensky was elected as the sixth president of Ukraine on April 21, and he is expected to take office no later than June 3.
