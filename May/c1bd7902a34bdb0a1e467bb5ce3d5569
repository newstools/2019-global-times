China's global anti-corruption manhunt saw the return of 374 fugitives in the first three months of 2019, the People's Daily reported Friday. During the period, nearly 624 million yuan (about 91.8 million US dollars) of illegal gains were recovered by the manhunt operation codenamed "Sky Net 2019," according to the newspaper. The "Sky Net 2019" was launched in January to capture more fugitive suspects and prevent more corrupt officials from fleeing. The 2018 "Sky Net" operation saw 1,335 fugitives being returned from overseas, recovering 3.54 billion yuan. China launched the first "Sky Net" operation in April 2015.
