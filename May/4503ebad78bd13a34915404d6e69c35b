Just 12 days after premiered in the Chinese mainland, Avengers: Endgame has earned 496 million yuan ($73.16 million) in IMAX box-office revenue, a new record, IMAX China announced on Monday. The film earned 145 million yuan at the IMAX box office during the four-day International Workers' Day holiday (May 1-4), the best performance ever for IMAX during the holiday. This helped the film reach the 400 million yuan benchmark, something no film shown in an IMAX China theater has achieved before. The 12-day IMAX revenue for Avengers: Endgame is nearly double the entire IMAX run of Avengers: Infinity War in the Chinese mainland. Avengers: Endgame is the second Hollywood film in history to be shot entirely with IMAX cameras, following Avengers: Infinity War. While IMAX screens only account for 1 percent of all screens in the mainland, 13 percent of the Hollywood blockbuster's box-office earnings in the Chinese mainland come from IMAX China. In a statement, IMAX Entertainment President Megan Colligan said the film continues to surpass expectations and conveyed his gratitude to the film's Chinese fans.
