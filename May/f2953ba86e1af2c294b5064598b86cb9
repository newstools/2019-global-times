The Secretary General of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Saeb Erekat said on Saturday that the PLO bodies have summoned for open meetings over means to confront and fight back the "century deal." Erekat told official Palestinian radio station Voice of Palestine that "Israel has ended all signed agreements and the US is attempting to destroy international legitimacy." He explained that the meetings are carried on in synchronization with dispatching delegates to other countries with a letter from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The letter explains the situation and the implement mechanism of the Palestinian Central and National Councils' decisions to sever ties with Israel "because the continuation of the status quo is not doable." Secretary general of Abbas's Fatah party revolutionary council Majed Fityani said that the council members will convene for consultation meetings in the next few days to discuss means to strengthen the internal front in face of Israeli and American decisions. Fityani told the Voice of Palestine radio station that the US will not be able to pass its "century deal" and the Palestinian people will not surrender to the Israeli and American measures. The Palestinian Authority declared that it has boycotted the American administration since it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in Dec. 2017 and moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem last May. Since then, US administration has taken several steps against Palestinians, including shutting down the PLO office in Washington, cutting aid to the only UN agency providing support to the Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) and cutting aid to the Palestinians.
