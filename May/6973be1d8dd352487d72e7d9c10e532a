Two counties in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality have cast off poverty, reducing the city's number of impoverished counties to four, said the municipal poverty alleviation office. Fengjie County and Shizhu Tujia Autonomous County have passed reviews by poverty relief offices at various levels and reached required development levels, the office said. The comprehensive poverty head-count ratio in the two counties has declined to below 3 percent. Last year three counties in Chongqing were lifted out of poverty thanks to a series of intensified anti-poverty measures. China aims to eradicate poverty by 2020, the target year to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.
