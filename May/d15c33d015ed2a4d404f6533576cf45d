The film has incorporated the strong personal style of the director, and created an atmosphere of bleakness and uncertainty," one netizen said on Sina Weibo. "Though each character in the film strives to live better, life is not always good. However, the director has made me feel warm by highlighting the shining part of humanity.""It's good to see more and more Chinese films winning prizes from international film festivals, which proves that China's film industry has not only achieved huge success at the box office but at awards in recent years," Tao Wenfang, a Guangzhou-based film and TV critic, told the Global Times on Monday.But awards from international film festivals are not the sole standard to measure the quality of a film, and Chinese people should "keep a common mind and be confident about our own films," Tao noted, adding that Chinese blockbusters like Wolf Warriors 2 and The Wandering Earth have not won top prizes on the international stage, but they still represent a milestone in the Chinese film industry.
