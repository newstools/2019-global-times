Eleven elephants with beautiful tusks from Ayutthaya Province on Tuesday paraded outside the Grand Palace in Bangkok in honor of the coronation of the King. The pachyderms in beautiful uniforms kicked off the 1-km parade Tuesday morning from the Territorial Defense Command on Sanam Chai road to the location in front of the Grand Palace. A male pachyderm 'Plai Siam' carried the royal emblem, leading ten other elephants to march in the procession along with the rhythm of the drum. The elephants and marchers stopped and knelt down to pay their respects to the royal portrait and representatives of elephant handlers sang the royal anthem to express loyalty to His Majesty the King. The Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal and elephants keepers nationwide transported the 11 elephants by truck from Ayutthaya province. When they arrived at the Territorial Defense Command, the elephants were dressed up and a ceremony was performed by elephant keepers before the beginning of the parade. Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn ascended to the throne becoming King Rama X following his father's death in 2016. His coronation ceremonies were held from May 4-6 to wholly complete the process of ascension according to Thai tradition.
