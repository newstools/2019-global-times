Nearly 200 domestic exhibitors are showcasing their products Friday at the 2019 China Brand Day series held in Shanghai, which focuses on the exposition of indigenous brands. Quality goods including the latest hydrogen FCVs, smart pianos with a recording function, and gel pens made of a degradable material are showcased in 13 experience zones of consumer goods at the Shanghai Exhibition Center. The booth area for businesses covers more than 20,000 square meters, where visitors can participate in online and offline interactive activities such as live demonstrations, virtual images, live streaming, online shopping, and interacting with celebrities. An official with the National Development and Reform Commission, one of the hosts of the event, said this year's China Brand Day plays an important role in the building of more brands and the forming of a strong domestic market. The 2019 International Forum on China Brand Development and seven sub-forums will be held during the three-day event. Established in 2017, the China Brand Day is marked on May 10 every year.
