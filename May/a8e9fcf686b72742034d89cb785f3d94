The city has also banned female poplar and willow trees from future urban planning and is cutting down branches to prevent the seeds. To better address the problem, Gao suggested that "We can instead plant triploid poplar trees that produce less seeds or inject medicine into existing trees to make them produce fewer seeds." But it was "impossible and against the law of nature to totally stop them from producing seeds," Gao said. Gao suggested removing some trees from residential areas to reduce the impact on ordinary people's daily life and leaving those in lesser-populated areas to control the impact on the environment.
