About 100 rockets were fired on Saturday from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, reported by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). With the launching of the rockets, sirens sounded all over the southern Israel, as far as the city of Rehovot located more than 50 km north of the Gaza Strip border. A 15-year-old boy was slightly injured while running to find shelter in the city of Sderot. Two other Israelis suffered shock and were treated by medical teams. According to the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, dozens of the rockets were intercepted by Iron Dome air defense systems. One of the rockets hit a house and another fell in the yard of another in Israeli settlements near the border, not causing any injuries. Following the rocket fire, roads, beaches and national parks in southern Israel were closed, and soccer games were canceled. The announcement also said that following the rocket fire, IDF tanks targeted Hamas military posts in the Gaza Strip. Due to the conflict escalation in the area, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intends to hold consultations with heads of the state's security bodies. On Friday, two Israeli soldiers were injured during the weekly Palestinian demonstrations near the border fence. In response, the Israeli Air Force attacked Hamas positions in the southern Gaza Strip, killing three people, according to Palestinian reports.
