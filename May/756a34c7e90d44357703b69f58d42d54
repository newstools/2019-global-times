China's 300-community satellite television project for Ghana which started since September has been completed. Handing over the completed project here on Friday, Chinese Ambassador to Ghana Wang Shiting underscored the need for Ghana and China to work together to eliminate the digital divide. "Since our poor communities still lack the ability to have the whole world in view, as well as the means to participate in cultural exchanges, let us work hard together to eliminate the digital divide," Wang said. The completion of the project, according to Ghana's Deputy Minister for Communications George Andah, was another step in the strengthening of the strong relations between Ghana and China. He said 660 Ghanaians have acquired technical training on the installation of satellite dishes through the project, which has given them skills to set up their own installation businesses.
