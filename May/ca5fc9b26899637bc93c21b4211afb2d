China will actively participate in Arctic affairs and strive to contribute its wisdom and strength to the sustainable development of the Arctic, Wang Hong, chief of the State Oceanic Administration, said Friday. Attending the Arctic Circle China Forum held in Shanghai, Wang proposed to conduct joint scientific expeditions to the North Pole and share the observation data with other countries to promote the monitoring and assessment of climate and environmental change in the Arctic in order to deepen the exploration and understanding of the Arctic. China would like to work with other countries to conduct scientific assessments of the impacts of global climate change and human activities on the Arctic ecosystem, and promote international cooperation in the protection of Arctic species and the natural restoration of the Arctic ecosystem, Wang said. China hopes to consolidate and expand the partnership with countries along the Arctic Circle, promote cultural and economic exchanges and build a "Silk Road on Ice" for the better future for the Arctic, said Wang. About 500 diplomats, scholars and entrepreneurs from countries and regions including China, Iceland, the United States, Canada, the European Union, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Japan, the Republic of Korea and India, as well as representatives of Arctic aborigines, attended the forum themed "China and the Arctic." At the initiative of Iceland, the Arctic Circle Assembly was founded in 2013, which is the largest international gathering concerning the Arctic. The assemblies are held every October in Iceland, and special Arctic Circle forums are held in other countries.
