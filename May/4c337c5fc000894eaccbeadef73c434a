Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the 2019 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), which opened Tuesday in Beijing. "With the deepening of economic globalization, trade in services has become a key part of international trade and an important area for economic and trade cooperation among nations, injecting new impetus to the world economic growth," Xi said in the letter. Noting that there are broad prospects and huge potential for the development of service trade, he called on countries to seize the opportunity and work together to forge a bright future of global services with mutual, shared benefits. Xi stressed that China is committed to promoting higher-standard opening up, firmly upholds the multilateral trading system, and will expand market access for foreign capital in broader areas and create a first-class business environment. China is willing to deepen cooperation on service trade and investment with other countries, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and make economic globalization more open, inclusive, and balanced so that all share its benefits, Xi said. He said he hopes delegates and guests at the fair deepen exchanges, build consensus, and strengthen cooperation to contribute to the prosperity of global trade in services and the building of a community with a shared future for humanity.
