The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra performed at the Poly Theater in Beijing on Sunday night, completing the fifth leg of their seven-city tour of China. Under the baton of famous Czech conductor Petr Altrichter and led by the youngest concertmaster in the history of orchestra, Josef Špaek, the orchestra introduced the "sound of Czechia" to audiences in the capital.A "national treasure" of the Czech Republic, the orchestra was named one of CNN's Top Ten Orchestras in the World in 2015. The orchestra has performed in many countries, communicating with audiences from different cultures through a single common language: music. The orchestra has deep connection with China as well. This year marks the 60th anniversary of its first visit to China and also the 70th anniversary of the establishment of China-Czech diplomatic relations. At a media event before the Beijing performance, pianist David Mareek, CEO of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and violinist Jií Vodika were greeted with a round of applause. Vladimir Tomsik, Czech Ambassador to China, also expressed his good wishes for the performance. The orchestra kicked off its China tour on May 11, performing in Nanjing, Wuhan, Fuzhou and Hangzhou prior to arriving in Beijing. The orchestra is scheduled to perform in the Henan Art Center in Henan Province on Tuesday and then wrap up the tour at the Zhuhai Opera House in Guangdong Province on Thursday.
