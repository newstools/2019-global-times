A Vietnamese delegation visited southwest China's Guizhou Province to boost exchanges in tourism. The delegation, consisting of 38 people from Vietnamese tourism associations, visited several tourist attractions in Guizhou, according to the provincial department of culture and tourism. The beautiful scenery and diverse culture in Guizhou will make the province a hot destination for Vietnamese tourists, according to the delegates. The delegates hope to enhance tourism cooperation, calling on the two sides to launch direct flights linking Guiyang, the provincial capital, to Hanoi and Nha Trang. They hope Guizhou authorities will issue favorable policies to attract more Vietnamese visitors, adding that it was their goal to see at least 30,000 trips by Vietnamese visitors to Guizhou annually by 2020.
