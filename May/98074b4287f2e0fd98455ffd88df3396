Five government departments, including the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), released a document to support ultra-low emission standards in China's steel industry by setting limits that vary by category.According to the document, which was sent by the MEE to the Global Times on Sunday, the government will set different emission limits and management measures for organized emissions, fugitive emissions as well as bulk material transportation. The document also specifies different emission limits for different pollution sources including sintering machine heads. These classifications show the "scientific nature" of the document, as the government has not adopted a one-size-fits-all system for managing emissions, He Kebin, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, wrote in an article that was also sent by the MEE to the Global Times. According to the document, China will also increase policy support in such areas including taxation and financing policies, to companies that complete a transformation to ultra-low emissions. The document also sets goals for steel emission modifications. The ultra-low emission modification in domestic steel companies in key regions will achieve "marked progress" by the end of 2020, with 60 percent of China's capacity likely to be transformed by that time. By the end of 2025, the process will be mostly finished in key industries of the country and more than 80 percent of steel capacity expected to be transformed. According to He, implementation of the emission reforms will cause total emissions of particulates to decrease by 21 percent compared with the current level in North China's Jingjinji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area) and surrounding areas, as well as by 20 percent in the Yangtze River Delta area.
