This can help frontier soldiers holding BeiDou-enabled terminals on mission, either at land or sea, to contact the rear more efficiently, helping the frontier soldiers better respond to emergency situations, Yang saidAccording to Yang, "the system has also been used as part of the local anti-terrorist campaign in Xinjiang, which has been proven effective."NORINCO's display board for the system at the exhibition area shows  that customers of such a system include the country's land and maritime frontier army, public security and coast guards.
