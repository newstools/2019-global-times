The first movie co-produced by China and Kazakhstan was previewed Thursday in the city of Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei Province. The movie, "Musician," tells a story of how the late Chinese musician Xian Xinghai was saved and helped by a Kazakh peer during World War II. Xian was a 20th century Chinese composer best known for his work "Yellow River Cantata". Shooting the movie took nearly five years, in which about 20,000 people participated from across China, Kazakhstan and Russia. "I believe the audiences in China, Kazakhstan and other countries around the world will love the movie," said Qian Daobo, the niece of the Chinese musician. The movie will be screened nationwide on May 17.
