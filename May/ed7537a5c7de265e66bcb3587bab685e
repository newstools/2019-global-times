China's top political advisor Wang Yang on Thursday called on Taiwan business people to actively participate in cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation in various fields. Wang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks when meeting with delegates to the fifth members' congress of the Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises on the Mainland (ATIEM). Hailing the contributions made by Taiwan business people in facilitating the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, Wang, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, called on the ATIEM to uphold the 1992 Consensus and the one-China principle, and to resolutely oppose "Taiwan independence." Wang urged the ATIEM to build stronger confidence in the mainland's development and cross-Strait economic cooperation and to unite Taiwan compatriots in doing more things to promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations. Noting that the mainland boasts strong economic momentum and ever-deepening reform and opening up, Wang called on Taiwan business people to grasp the opportunity to be participants, promoters and frontrunners of cross-Strait economic and social integration. He vowed to implement and improve the mainland's preferential policies for Taiwan and to make it more convenient for Taiwan enterprises to invest and do business in the mainland.
