The Iron Dome Aerial Defense System has intercepted over 240 of them.At the same time, the Israeli air force carried out massive airstrikes in Gaza, bombing buildings and militant targets throughout the besieged Palestinian enclave.At least 23 Palestinians were killed, including two pregnant women and two babies and at least nine militants, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.In Israel, four civilians were killed, at least three of them were Israeli nationals, according to official Israeli figures.
