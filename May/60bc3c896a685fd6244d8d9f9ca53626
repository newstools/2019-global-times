The Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises on the Mainland (ATIEM) said it will firmly adhere to the 1992 Consensus and promote peaceful development of cross-Strait relations. Li Zhenghong, the new president of ATIEM, made the remarks Thursday in Beijing after his election. The ATIEM should help Taiwan-funded businesses seize opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative, the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, said Li. "We need to pool wisdom and strength for the healthy development of Taiwan-invested enterprises and promote win-win economic and trade cooperation across the Strait," he said.
