British Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove speaks to the media outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, Dec. 12, 2018. British Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to survive a vote of no confidence late Wednesday as 158 Conservative members of parliament publicly voiced support for her, British media reported.
