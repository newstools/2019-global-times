The US' Philadelphia Orchestra, one of the preeminent orchestras in the world, will participate in a number of residency activities during its 2019 Tour of China, aiming to deepen people-to-people exchanges through music.In addition to performances in at least five Chinese cities, the China tour will also feature abundant residency activities to facilitate two-way communication between US and Chinese musicians, according to a recent statement from The Philadelphia Orchestra.The activities will consist of side-by-side concerts, master classes, coaching sessions, chamber performances and pop-up performances in several Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou."This innovative and meaningful model of cultural exchange is a beautiful example of our special relationship with China and a powerful reminder of how music connects us all," said music director Yannick Nezet-Seguin, who will lead the orchestra on its tour of China.The move "will continue our tradition of pursuing deeper engagement outside of the hall, as well, in communities throughout our travels," he added.Founded in 1900, The Philadelphia Orchestra made a historic visit to China in 1973, becoming the first US orchestra to make a China tour since the founding of the People's Republic of China.Since then, it has traveled to China frequently, representing a bridge for cultural and people-to-people exchanges.The orchestra announced in late January that it will visit China May 16-28 - the orchestra's 12th tour to China - to mark the four-decade milestone in US-China diplomatic relations.
