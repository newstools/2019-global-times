Rare underground ancestral hall in tombs dating back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) was found in northern China's Shanxi Province, according to the provincial institute of archaeology. The hall, with a square side length of 1 meter and 1.16 meters under the ground surface, was unearthed in the city of Yangquan, Shanxi, along with two damaged tombs. Ancient relics of pottery pots, porcelain balls, coins and mirrors were also unearthed in the hall and the two south-faced ancient tombs, octagonal shaped, were built with bricks. According to their location, decoration and the unearthed objects, the relics are confirmed to be built in the same period, a rare scene in the Yuan Dynasty. Shanxi boasts abundant cultural heritage, with more than 53,000 immovable cultural relics, including ancient ruins, tombs and architecture. It is home to 452 cultural relics sites under state protection, the highest of all provincial regions.
