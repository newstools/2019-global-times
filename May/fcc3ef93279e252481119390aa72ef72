People take wedding photos in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province in April. Photo: ICThe sewing machines in Dingji, a small town in East China's Anhui Province, were whirring on Friday.On its surface, the remote town, more than 400 kilometers from Shanghai, does not appear to be a romantic place. But for many women in China and across the globe, the glamorous gowns they wear when they say "I do" have their origins in this unsuspecting place.When a woman in Beijing or Shanghai chooses her dream dress, she may not expect the clothing for her big day to have been produced in a place she had never heard of."There are more than 10,000 wedding dresses shipped to other places in the country from Dingji every day," said Xu Youzhong, general manager of Dingji-based Zhongyuan Wedding Dress Co. Xu has been working in the wedding dress industry for more than 20 years."It takes about one week to make a wedding dress, and wholesale prices range from around 1,000 yuan ($147) to 3,000 yuan each," Xu told the Global Times on Friday."There are more than 600 wedding dress producers in Dingji, and about 60 percent of them are small workshops consisting of 20 to 30 workers," Xu said, noting that others are bigger, like his firm, which has more than 160 people.After the wedding dresses are shipped to bridal stores in Beijing, the prices may double, triple or even more."The average price to rent a wedding dress is about 3,700 yuan in our store, which is one third of the price to buy one," a sales person at a store in Beijing's Chaoyang district, who preferred to remain anonymous, told the Global Times on Friday.However, Xu's company, like many others now located in Dingji, was not always based in the small town. Most of them shifted from the Huqiu area of Suzhou in East China's Jiangsu Province.Returning homeHuqiu, which is around 500 kilometers southeast of Dingji, has become one of the most famous wedding dress production bases in the country over the past three decades.The annual output of wedding dresses in Huqiu totals about 2 billion yuan and accounts for nearly 70 percent of the market in China, domestic news site jiemian.com reported, citing local official data.Since the end of 2017, local departments in Huqiu have conducted safety measures after several fires broke out in rental housing, the report said. Wedding dress workshops that did not meet fire safety standards were required to move.At that time, local departments responsible for attracting investment and business to Dingji saw an opportunity and went to Huqiu to offer favorable policies to entice Dingji natives doing business in Huqiu to return to their hometown."I returned to Dingji in July 2018, and 60 percent of my previous employees came with me," Xu said."After deciding to come back, we quickly found a factory and hired some employees in Dingji. It's good to run the business in my hometown as labor costs are relatively cheap here," he said.Xu said the value of daily production is 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and some products are sold to overseas markets such as Turkey and Russia. Media reported that of all wedding dresses sold worldwide, 70 percent come from China."More efforts will be made to expand our presence in foreign markets in the future," he said. "For instance, we plan to enter more countries in Europe and the Middle East by 2020 through cross-border e-commerce business."First industrial townThanks to regional integration development among East China's provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Shanghai, many industries based in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been transferred to central regions of the country, Wang Shanlin, vice general manager of Anhui Zhedong Group, told the Global Times on Thursday.As Huqiu committed to upgrading its industry and transferring many labor-intensive industries to other areas, Dingji was positioned for opportunity as 70 percent of businessmen in Huqiu came from Anhui's prefecture-level city of Lu'an, and 70 percent of those from Lu'an were from the town of Dingji, Wang said."Dingji had the industrial base to receive the industry because many households in some villages under the town also made wedding dresses for a living during recent years," Wang said.But most wedding dress producers in Dingji were small and micro firms and occupied the low end of the industry, noted Wang."Our company invested 2.1 billion yuan to develop an industrial town in Dingji, mainly featuring wedding dress production, along with other related sectors such as wedding celebration tourism and photography," he said, The construction of the industrial town, which will cover 3.15 square kilometers, will start later in May and its first phase is scheduled to open to the public by the end of this year, according to Wang."Therefore, the industrial town will serve as an incubator to help upgrade the local wedding dress production industry in the future," Wang said.He said that after construction finishes, small business will move into the industrial town.After moving into the industrial town, factory standards and production will be guaranteed, according to Xu."The industrial town will become the first of its kind in the country," Wang said.A romantic futureSound prospects and large market demand have advanced the growth of China's wedding dress industry during recent years.Major production firms in the sector have concentrated in places like Chaozhou, Guangzhou and Zhongshan in South China's Guangdong Province and Xiamen and Quanzhou in East China's Fujian Province.Starting in the 1980s, the demand for wedding dresses in China began to surge, and the demand has continued to rise during recent years, Xu Changying, general manager of Dingji New Era Wedding Dress Co, told the Global Times on Thursday."One wedding dress is not enough for a bride now. They also need wedding outfits for welcoming guests and making toasts and an evening party dress," he said. "For some traditional Chinese weddings, traditional Chinese-style wedding attire has enjoyed increased popularity." There is large growth potential in the Chinese wedding dress production industry for the future thanks to rising demand and a large population base in the country, Xu said, noting that e-commerce business will become a major driving force. Production bases in South China's Guangdong Province have mainly focused on producing high-end wedding dresses, while firms in Dingji make mid- and low-end products, he said.The annual production volume of wedding dresses in Chaozhou, Guangdong has reached about 20 million, worth $4 billion, and more than 70 percent of the dresses are sold overseas in over 20 countries and regions, according to media reports. But if the Chinese bridal industry wants to continue to shine in global markets, more focus is expected to be put on innovative design, industrial insiders said. By the end of 2018, the number of employees in the sector exceeded 30,000, according to media reports.Newspaper headline: Small town romance Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Actress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame starDelegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growth
