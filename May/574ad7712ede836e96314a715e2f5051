There is no reason in the world to paralyze the state for another half a year and spend billions on elections," Netanyahu said in the evening.However, he admitted that he had not yet persuaded Avigdor Lieberman, head of Yisrael Beiteinu party, to join the coalition.Netanyahu made the statement shortly after the Israeli parliament decided to dissolve itself in a preliminary vote fewer than two months after the April 9 general elections.Just before his statement, Netanyahu met with Lieberman at the parliament, but the two did not reach an agreement.According to Israeli law, Netanyahu had 28 days to form the government, before he received a two-week extension which will expire on Wednesday's midnight.The right-wing parties won 65 out of the 120 seats in the Israeli parliament, but without the five seats gained by Lieberman's party, Netanyahu will not be able to form a coalition with a stable majority.Lieberman refuses to join the government because Netanyahu does not accept his demand to amend the draft law to set army recruitment quotas for ultra-Orthodox Jewish students.This amendment is opposed by Yahadut Hatorah and Shas, two ultra-Orthodox parties which are planned to join Netanyahu's coalition.
