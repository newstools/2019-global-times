A total of 162 people lost their lives in traffic accidents during the Easter holiday, down by 48 percent from the previous year, Transport Minister Blade Nzimande said on Thursday. "The number of deaths decreased by 48 percent from 309 in 2018 to 162 in 2019. This marks a decrease of 147 fatalities," the minister said, adding that human behavior, especially recklessness, has been identified as one of the major contributors to the death toll. Traffic officials' visibility throughout the weekend contributed to the reduction. The Transport department's strategy to clamp down on drunk drivers resulted in over 800 drivers being nabbed. "The highest alcohol readings were reported in Gauteng. 192 drivers were arrested for speeding," he said. Despite the reduction in road carnage, Nzimande said the government is still concerned about the number of people dying on the roads, adding that the department was committed to root out corruption which has resulted in fatalities. "We intend to be harsher with law enforcement officers who take bribes, as this undermines all our efforts in curbing road crashes, injuries and fatalities and tarnishing the image of other good officers."
