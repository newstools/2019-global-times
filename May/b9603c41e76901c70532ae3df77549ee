Meanwhile, the sector generated 603.8 billion yuan (87.37 billion U.S. dollars) of revenue, up 21.8 percent from the previous year.However, environmental pollution triggered by mass express packaging has aroused concern.

It is not just about the express industry, but the whole of society. And the establishment of 'Green Delivery Day' can attract more people to engage," a customer said at the launching ceremony.
