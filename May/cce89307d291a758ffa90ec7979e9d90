Chinese President Xi Jinping Wednesday delivered a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations (CDAC) in Beijing. Following are some highlights of his speech.Â -- Besides economic and technological strength, cultural strength is also needed for humanity to cope with common challenges and head toward a bright future.-- We hope that all Asian countries will respect and trust each other, co-exist in harmony, expand cross-border, cross-time-and-space as well as cross-civilization exchanges, and jointly maintain the peaceful time that is more valuable than gold.
-- Civilizations will lose vitality if countries go back to isolation and cut themselves off from the rest of the world.
-- It is foolish to believe that one's race and civilization are superior to others, and it is disastrous to willfully reshape or even replace other civilizations.
-- Various civilizations are not destined to clash.
-- Exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations should be conducted in a reciprocal and equal manner, and be diversified and multi-directional. The exchanges should neither be compulsory or forced, nor one-directional.
-- Civilizations need to keep pace with the times.-- In the future, China will surely embrace the world with a more open posture and contribute more dynamic civilization achievements to the world.
