However, it only takes one hour and 15 minutes by air.During the early operation period, the service will offer single, monthly, season and annual tickets. A one-way fare is 1,200 ($178) yuan per person while monthly tickets are priced at 3,000 yuan ($445) per person, a season card will cost 8,000 yuan, and the annual ticket price is 30,000 yuan, the company said.Founded in April 2018, Jiangxi Express Aviation aims to build a one-hour commuting circle within the province, and it expects to expand to more provinces as well.At present, it has five Swiss Pilatus PC-12NG aircraft, and it plans to reach 15 aircraft by the end of 2019 and expand its fleet size to 60 aircraft within 5 years.The firm is working to explore an air-plus-tourism model, and it also plans to launch a new air route between Nanchang and Jingdezhen, a Jiangxi city known for its fine porcelain, in July. Jiangxi has been making more efforts in the aviation industry in recent years. Xinhua reported that the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd, China's major commercial aircraft developer, has announced it will build a production and test center in Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi Province.With an investment of 2 billion yuan ($300 million), the center will be mainly responsible for the interior installation, painting, flight test, delivery and maintenance of jetliner ARJ21.The ARJ21 is China's first regional jetliner, with 78 to 90 seats and a range of 3,700 kilometers.
