Officials in Heihe, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, were punished for taking their subordinates to see "Avengers: Endgame."Zhang Dexin, director of a customer service center at a local heating company, and two deputy directors, Cao Yang and Liu Yang, took their employees to the theater on a workday last month so they could see the Hollywood blockbuster .After authorities received an anonymous tip, they conducted a surprise inspection, and discovered only two employees were on hand, and both were from outside departments. Authorities determined that all personnel involved had violated disciplinary work codes and were a negative influence. An official notice was issued later that said Zhang received a warning from the Communist Party of China (CPC) and was relieved of his post, along with Cao and Liu. The department employees were ordered to make self-criticisms. The regulations of CPC stipulate that being irresponsible at work or negligent in management and poorly deploying and implementing decisions made by higher-level departments are clear discipline violations."Avengers: Endgame" is the highest-grossing Hollywood film played in China, earning over $614 million in the country, according to Chinese online ticket service, Maoyan.
