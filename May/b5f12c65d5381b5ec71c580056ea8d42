home to a significant Arab population - and London and Dublin.  Anti-occupation NGO Breaking the Silence erected a billboard in Israel with the slogan "Dare to Dream of Freedom," playing on the 2019 contest's slogan "Dare to Dream."Iceland's entry Hatari had been expected to spark controversy.The band - who dress in so-called BDSM outfits, bondage clothing including leather and whips - have been critical of Israel and previously challenged Netanyahu to a Glima, a Nordic folk wrestling match.Newspaper headline: Political shadow Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Actress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame starUnrealistic expectations thwart Chinese job recruitersDelegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los Angeles
