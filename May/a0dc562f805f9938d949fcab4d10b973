Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) culture was promoted in New Zealand in a sideline event during the Tripartite 2019 meetings this week. Taking Tripartite 2019 as an opportunity, Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited (GPHL) set up a partnership with the Confucius Institute in Auckland to establish a Shennong Caotang TCM Culture Communication Centre, which is the first of its kind outside China. The company also signed an agreement with the University of Auckland to set up the Wang Lao Ji Auspicious Culture Ambassador Scholarship to fund students for their internships in Guangzhou. This move was witnessed by officials and representatives from Guangzhou and Auckland municipalities, the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand, the Chinese Consulate General in Auckland, the University of Auckland, the Confucius Institute and GPHL. An exhibition of traditional Chinese medicine culture was held at the same time in the University of Auckland, attracting a large number of audience, with many expecting to gain a deeper understanding of the traditional Chinese culture. Speaking at the Tripartite meetings in Auckland on Monday, Li Chuyuan, party secretary and chairman of Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, shared his thoughts on traditional Chinese medicine and health. "Many countries in the world are now troubled by the escalating medical costs, and traditional Chinese medicine provides a cost-effective solution to this global problem. In order to help more people take advantage of the health benefits of TCM, we now plan to make full use of the advanced technologies and the prevailing marketing approaches to produce the most needed healthcare products to the general public. By doing so, we will actively advance the modernization, internationalization, popularization and massification of TCM," said Li.
