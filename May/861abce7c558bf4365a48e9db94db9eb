The press conference held on Wednesday Photo: Shen Weiduo/GTChinese courts have processed the most intellectual property rights (IPR) cases, especially those involving patents, in the world, said an official from China's top court on Wednesday, a sign that the country has made great progress to protect IPR."China is increasingly becoming a preferred venue for settling international IPR disputes. The credibility, attractiveness and influence of Chinese courts in the field of international IPR protection have improved," Lin Guanghai, a deputy chief judge of the No 3 Civil Adjudication Tribunal, the IPR division of the Supreme People's Court, told a press conference on Wednesday in Beijing.The courts have concluded a series of cases with international influence, involving the Michael Jordan trademark dispute and the patent infringement disputes between Huawei and Samsung in recent years, according to Lin.The number of IPR cases accepted by Chinese courts throughout the country totaled 334,951 last year, up 41.2 percent year-on-year. The number of resolved cases hit 319,651, up 41.6 percent year-on-year, according to report released at the conference that discussed IPR protection and the business environment in China.China's top court opened an Intellectual Property Court in Beijing in January, responsible for handling civil and administrative appeals related to patents. In 2018, eight IPR courts were established across the country.China has been striving to improve its IPR management system in recent years amid an escalating trade war with the US, which has blamed China for so-called forced technology transfers, and copied its technological innovations."Enhancing the protection of IPR is a commitment China made upon its entry into the WTO. Moreover, it's an inherent need for the development of China itself," read the IPR report.The country has made solid progress in IPR protection, including a trial reform of IPR cases, strengthened law enforcement and judicial protection, as well as more integrated international cooperation in the sector, Gan Lin, vice minister of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said during the conference on Wednesday.An improved IPR environment has also improved the business climate for both domestic and foreign companies in the country, which has been recognized at a worldwide level and attracted more foreign investment.Â According to a report from the World Bank, China ranked 46 in terms of the business environment last year, a rise of 32 slots compared with 2017. The improvement was third in the world and first in East Asia and the Pacific region.China will always align with internationally prevailing rules to protect IPR according to law and on an equal footing for both domestic and foreign investors, crack down on IPR infringement and counterfeiting and foster a favorable business environment, read the report.
