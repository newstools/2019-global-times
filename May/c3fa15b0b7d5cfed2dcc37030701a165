Search continued to find a missing trainer airplane with two people aboard that vanished on Friday shortly after takeoff in Occidental Mindoro province, the Philippine aviation authorities said on Sunday. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) said the twin-engine Beechcraft Baron 55 plane's last known position was 16 nautical miles south of San Jose town in Occidental Mindoro province before it went missing around 8:13 a.m. local time on Friday. A Filipino pilot and a Saudi Arabian student were on board, CAAP said. The Philippine Air Force, the Philippine Navy, the Philippine Coast Guard, and a King Air private jet launched an air and sea search on Saturday but the operation was unsuccessful. CAAP said it would look into the cause of the accident.
