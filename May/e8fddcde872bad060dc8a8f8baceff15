Waseem Baig, spokesperson for the Civil Hospital Quetta, told Xinhua that they had received two bodies and 25 injured people at the hospital.

According to police officials, the blast took place at about 1:15 p.m. local time at the Rehmania Mosque in the Pashtoonabad area of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan. Around 30 to 40 worshippers were present in the mosque to offer Friday prayer when the blast occurred, said local TV channel Geo News. The blast was carried out through planted device, said police, adding that the explosion was so loud that it left windowpanes of the houses in nearby densely populated areas shattered. No group or person has taken claim of the explosion, according to initial reports. Police and rescue teams rushed to the site following the incident and shifted the bodies and injured to the Civil Hospital Quetta, where five of the injured were reportedly in critical condition.
