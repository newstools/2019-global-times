In case of a severe accident and failure of the active subsystem, the valves at the bottom of the tank will  open automatically and the water in the tank will flow freely down to submerge and cool the reactor," Xing explained. Hualong One's containment also applies an a double-wall structure. The outer containment, about 1.8 meters thick, is made of reinforced concrete and withstands aircraft crashes, explosions and missiles; and the internal containment, about a meter thick, is made of pre-stressed concrete that can prevent radioactive substances from leaking in case of accidents.
