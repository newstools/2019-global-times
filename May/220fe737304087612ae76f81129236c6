China will fight against pneumoconiosis, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of all occupational disease cases in the country, said Li Bin, deputy head of China's National Health Commission (NHC). Li made the remarks at a press briefing held by the State Council Information Office Monday, adding that people diagnosed with the disease are at an increasingly younger age. The NHC, with assistance from other departments, will make efforts to control dust hazards in industries including mining, metallurgy and construction materials to reduce new pneumoconiosis patients, he said. Administrations will also expand coverage of employment injury insurance and medical insurance to guarantee necessary treatment for pneumoconiosis patients, according to Li. Employment injury insurance covered nearly 239 million employees by the end of last year, including over 80 million migrant workers.
