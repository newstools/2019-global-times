China's Ministry of Education has asked universities to improve administration to boost scientific research. In a circular, the ministry required simplifying procedures for reimbursement of expenses on research activities which include attending meetings, counseling, purchasing equipment and services, among others. Internet-based reimbursement is encouraged and approval will also be streamlined, according to the circular. It also demanded universities improve the system of appointing academic assistants and financial assistants for researchers, and allocate more funds to raise researchers' bonuses. The interference with scientific research must be reduced to a minimum, the circular said.
