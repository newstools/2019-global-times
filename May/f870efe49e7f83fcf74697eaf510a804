The manufacturing hub in the Pearl River Delta area has been quite calm: Businesses are trying to find new export destinations, studying the huge domestic market or exploring transformation."Difficulties have come, but if local companies can survive over the next three to five years, it will be a big success," said Lin Butian, chairman of Dongguan Electric Motor Co.Lin forecast that the China-US trade dispute will continue for the next few years, which will be a transitional period for both China and its businesses."There's nothing to be afraid of," Lin told the Global Times, adding "China can count on itself to find a way."Lin's motor business has been affected by the US tariffs since last year but not seriously, as the US market only took up 10 percent of its exports. "I have adjusted this year's financial target to 70-80 percent of the original goal, which was 480 million yuan ($69.38 million) in terms of sales," he noted.Next, Lin wants to focus on upgrading the company's products and services based on current market conditions instead of rapid expansion.Unlike Lin, Chen Liang, general manager of Dongguan Jinconn New Material Holdings Co, a private company that makes magnetic materials, is still seeking more customers. But what he aims for are domestic high-technology companies instead of foreign ones."You cannot count on foreign markets, which we cannot control," Chen told the Global Times on Wednesday, noting that more efforts are needed to explore the huge domestic market and serve the nation's consumption upgrade.Chen said that he shifted focus from foreign markets to the domestic one in June 2018 after he witnessed one of his customers, which had used Jinconn-made magnets in coffee machines, cut its orders from about 600,000 yuan to several thousand yuan in one month.Jinconn has won domestic orders from Huawei and OPPO to provide magnets for their smartphones. "We're actively hiring more skilled workers to keep up with rising orders," said Chen.Crucial supply chainIn the future, the focus will become supply chains instead of simple competition among companies, industry insiders said.Taking rare earths as an example, Chen said the US has been buying the material from China for years, and industrial chain related to the material has not existed in the country. So it is hard for the US to find a replacement in a short period.Rare earths are key raw materials used in electronic products and more than half of the US imports of these minerals are from China."The China-US trade war has caused some frustration for our business, but it is temporary," Chen said. "It is the US industry and consumers that will bear long-term losses," said Chen.In 2018, Dongguan's GDP reached 827.86 billion yuan, up 7.4 percent year-on-year, higher than the country's 6.6 percent growth rate and Guangdong Province's 6.8 percent expansion during the same period, official data showed.Newspaper headline: Companies stay on track amid trade war Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
