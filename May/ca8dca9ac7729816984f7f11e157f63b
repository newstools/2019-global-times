Two more Chinese airlines from the eastern province of Fujian have joined a number of others in the country in seeking compensation from the Boeing Company after the grounding of the 737 Max aircraft. Xiamen Airlines confirmed Friday that it has requested compensation for economic losses caused by its 10 737 Max aircraft that have been grounded since March 11. The airlines has moved the jets from airports in the coastal cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou to ones in the colder and drier northwest China for better protection. Fuzhou Airlines said it suffered losses due to the grounding of its two 737 Max aircraft and delayed delivery of more. The airlines' claims followed compensation requests from four big airlines, including China Eastern Airlines, Air China, China Southern Airlines, earlier this week. China was the first to halt the commercial operations of all Boeing 737 Max 8 airplanes after a deadly Ethiopian Airlines plane crash on March 10. It was the second crash of the aircraft after one operated by Indonesia's Lion Air crashed in October last year, triggering global scrutiny and bans on operating Boeing 737 Max aircraft. China's airlines own a total of 96 737 Max 8 planes, data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed.
