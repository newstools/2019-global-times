China's relief organizations protected 68,000 minors who were homeless or in need of help in 2018, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The country's 1,806 relief organizations for minors offered protection for those who were homeless or without guardians or victims of domestic violence, said Ni Chunxia, deputy head of the social affairs department of the ministry, at a press conference Monday.
