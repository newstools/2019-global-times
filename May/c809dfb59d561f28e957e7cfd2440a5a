At least seven people, including an assailant, were killed and six others wounded after a suicide car bomb blast struck outside a military university in western side of Afghan capital Kabul on Thursday, Afghan Ministry of Interior Affairs confirmed. "A suicide bomb blast occurred at a street in front of Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Police District 5. The initial information found six people were killed and six others wounded," the ministry said in a statement. More details would be made public later as investigation is underway to find more facts about the incident, the statement added. The blast occurred at around midday when military students were leaving the building. Security forces have cordoned off the area for precautionary measures. Several warning shots were also fired by the security forces. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. Over the past few months, Afghanistan, especially the capital Kabul, has witnessed waves of terror attacks by the Taliban insurgents and Islamic State (IS) outfit. Ten police officers, two religious scholars and a female official have been killed in separate incidents in Kabul since early this month.
