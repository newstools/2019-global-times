Editor's Note:The Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations (CDAC) is attracting attention worldwide as topics such as the theory of the clash of civilizations have spurred serious discussions during side events. Global Times reporters Wang Wenwen, Zhao Yusha and Zhang Ao interviewed CDAC delegates to get their ideas on the issues and how the conference, which started Wednesday in Beijing, will help promote mutual understanding and knowledge sharing. 

Alistair MichieAlistair Michie, Secretary General of British East Asia CouncilAsia has modernized in the last forty plus years with unprecedented speed and scale. It is embracing 60 percent of world's population. The dominance of Europe and the US on global affairs needs to be changed. However, there is a lack of communication between the East and West. People in Europe and the US don't know enough about Asia. A great example is that China used new thinking to achieve its reform and opening-up, which utterly changed the world. We need that kind of energy and innovation. I'm really excited that this conference is having a dialogue on civilizations and finding a way to create a community of common destiny. Because I strongly believe that the only way to solve many big global issues and challenges, such as tackling climate change, controlling nuclear weapons, creating a stable economic and financial system, is through all mankind acting together.
