Zhu said his team will continue to study the possible answers, such as continental weathering and tectonic activities.Continental weathering is among the primary processes responsible for the evolution of the landscape. It exerts a major influence on the transport of materials from the continents to the oceans and on the cycles of many elements on the Earth's surface.Previous studies have shown a possible relationship between oxygen content in the atmosphere and the oceans, and early animal evolution. But it was difficult to confirm due to the lack of ideal material and methods for analyzing ancient seawater oxygen, Zhu said.Despite a lack of continuous carbonate deposits in China, Zhu's team found that the Siberian Platform may serve as the key to the research. They collected samples of ancient rocks in the Siberian Platform in 2008 with the help of Russian scientists, and then worked with a UK team in analyzing carbon and sulfur isotopes in these rocks. The isotopic signatures of the rocks in Siberia are consistent with the global production of oxygen, allowing the team to determine oxygen levels in shallow seawater and the atmosphere during the Cambrian Period, according to a statement the NIGP sent to the Global Times. "By analyzing carbon and sulfur isotopes found in ancient rocks, we are able to trace oxygen variations in Earth's atmosphere and shallow oceans during the Cambrian Explosion," He Tianchen, study lead author and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Leeds, told the Global Times on Tuesday."We found that evolutionary radiations follow a pattern of 'boom and bust' in tandem with the oxygen levels," according to He. Newspaper headline: Oxygen content impacts evolution Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
