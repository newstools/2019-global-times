While on a recent state visit to Japan, US President Donald Trump said that the US "isn't ready" to make a trade deal with China.Talking about the status of the trade talks, Gao took a firm stance on Thursday, stressing that China will not compromise on its principles for a trade deal and said that "China bears no blame for a delay of the trade negotiations between the two sides. It's the fluctuating attitude of the US that hinders the good atmosphere for trade negotiations."He further noted that the progress of China-US trade talks depends to a large extent on the attitude and sincerity of the US side as consultations are only possible on the basis of equal treatment and mutual respect.
