China rejected Thursday recent irresponsible comments made by a US official against the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), saying that the international community will tell who is stirring up trouble and who is trying to make a difference. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang made the remarks at a press briefing in response to a question on reports that during a visit to the United Kingdom, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the BRI proposed by China violates other countries' sovereignty and urged Britain to be vigilant and voice its opposition. "Some individuals in the United States have been continuously making irresponsible comments against the BRI, which reached a crescendo before the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. "But what was the result? More than 6,000 delegates from 150 countries and 92 international organizations, including over 50 delegates from the United States, attended the forum," the spokesperson said. Geng said this is the international community taking actual actions to cast a vote of confidence and support in the BRI, and the best response to the words and actions of the United States. Certain individuals in the US began to play the same old tune in the past few days, and continued to attack and smear the BRI, Geng said. "I would like to remind them once again not to overestimate your ability of rumor-mongering, or underestimate other people's ability of judgment. If they wish so, they can continue talking the talk, but we will continue walking the walk."
