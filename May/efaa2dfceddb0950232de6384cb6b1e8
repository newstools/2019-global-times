British Environment Secretary Michael Gove announced Wednesday a new bill to ban the use of wild animals in traveling circuses across England. The Wild Animals in Circuses Bill means that circus operators in England will no longer be able to use wild animals as part of a traveling circus. "Traveling circuses are no place for wild animals in the 21st century, and I am pleased that this legislation will put an end to this practice for good," Gove said. Animal Welfare Minister David Rutley said: "The legislation will deliver on the ban that many welfare charities and parliamentarians have been calling for. The general public can still enjoy a trip to the circus, but it is good to know that wild animals will no longer be a part of that experience." The announcement follows a commitment by the British government in February 2018 to introduce a ban by the time the existing interim licensing regulations expire in January 2020, after years of campaigning of animal right groups. With similar legislations being passed in Scotland and expected to be brought to parliament in Wales, a nationwide ban in Britain is in sight. "After years of waiting for this issue to be resolved, Born Free is delighted that Mr. Gove will now bring this bill forward," said Chris Draper, head of Animal Welfare and Captivity at the international wildlife charity "Born Free Foundation," adding that the organization and its supporters look forward to swift progress of the bill through the parliament.
