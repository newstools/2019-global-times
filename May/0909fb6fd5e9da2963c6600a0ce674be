China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday declined to comment on an earlier tweet on the possibility that China would stop purchasing some US products, such as agriculture products and planes, but stopped short of denying such a measure, reiterating that China does not want to fight a trade war but is also not afraid of one.The Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said on his personal Twitter account on Monday that "China may stop purchasing US agricultural products and energy, reduce Boeing orders and restrict US services trade with China. Many Chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping US Treasuries and how to do it specifically."Replying a question raised by the Bloomberg News at a regular briefing on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said: "All I want to say is that China does not want a trade war, but we're not afraid of one. We have the determination and ability to protect our legal interests." "We urge the US to return to the right track and meet China halfway in a bid to reach a mutually beneficial deal based on respect, equality and promise keeping," Geng stressed.  "You should be clear about our stance that we don't comment specifically on views from experts, scholars, the media and think tanks," Geng noted.On Tuesday, Hu wrote on his Twitter that "Bloomberg can comment on my tweet freely. But no Bloomberg reporter interviewed me before it published this article. I think Bloomberg, as an influential media company, shouldn't tolerate falsifying interviews."Hu's comment came after a Bloomberg report on Monday about the Boeing 737 Max becoming a target of China's trade retaliation, which claimed that the news company had interviewed him.  "There's reason to be skeptical about this; for one, the Global Times isn't an official government mouthpiece and Hu later told Bloomberg News that he was expressing his opinion, not an official stance," the Bloomberg report said.
