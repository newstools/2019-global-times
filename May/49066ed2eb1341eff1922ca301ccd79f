British Prime Minister Theresa May stared at the prospect Thursday of her political career coming to an inglorious end after her final attempt to save her unpopular Brexit deal was met with condemnation in parliament and the resignation of a senior government figure.The beleaguered premier is in the last throes of a tumultuous rule focused all-but exclusively on guiding her fractured country out of the European Union.But three overwhelming rejections by parliament of the terms she struck with the other 27 nations last year have forced Britain to miss the original March 29 departure date and plead for more time.Anxious members of May's party met behind closed doors Wednesday to discuss changes to the rules that would let them vote no-confidence in her leadership in the days to come.Her woes were made worse when Andrea Leadsom - one of cabinet's strongest Brexit backers - resigned from her post as the government's representative in parliament over May's handling of the slowly unfolding crisis."I no longer believe that our approach will deliver on the [2016] referendum results," Leadsom said in her resignation letter.In her response May thanked Leadsom for her "passion, drive and sincerity," but took issue with her assessment of the government's Brexit strategy."I do not agree with you that the deal which we have negotiated with the European Union means that the United Kingdom will not become a sovereign country," MayÂ said.
