Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he would ask President Reuven Rivlin for more time to form a new coalition government, citing recent holidays and the Gaza flare-up.Netanyahu's Likud won 35 seats in the April 9 general election, with most party chiefs represented in the 120-seat parliament recommending that he forms the next governing coalition.On April 17 Rivlin ­formally tasked him with the mission, which by law needs to be completed within 28 days - although a 14-day extension is automatically granted upon request."Such an extension is not only acceptable but also required due to  scheduling problems," Netanyahu said in the opening remarks of the weekly cabinet meeting, citing a busy holiday season, including Passover and Israeli Independence Day, as well as the Gaza flare-up. On May 4, militants in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip fired hundreds of rockets at Israel, prompting the army to strike dozens of targets inside the blockaded coastal enclave in response.Four Israeli civilians and 25 Palestinians were killed in the two-day flare-up, which ended on May 6 in a tentative truce.Israel reopened Sunday its crossings with the blockaded Gaza Strip after closing them during the deadly escalation. Both the Erez crossing for people and Kerem Shalom crossing for goods were open and operating, a spokeswoman for COGAT, the defense ministry unit that oversees the crossings, said in a statement.
