Member units of the working group of the China Book International Project met on Tuesday in Harbin, capital city of Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, to brainstorm ideas to promote Chinese publications overseas.The member units mostly include publishing houses and companies across the country that meet on a regular basis to discuss relevant issues.China needs to show itself to the world, while the changing world needs to better read and understand China, attendees at the meeting noted.The excellent stories recorded over the 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China should be told with more dedication, emotion and effort, especially those about the historical changes and achievements the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the country have made since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the attendees said.Â They stressed that publication work should play an active role in serving the development of the country's Belt and Road Initiative, with more diverse and customized publications and further exploration of the international market to improve the country's influence along the Belt and Road.Attendees of the meeting also called for efforts to further promote Chinese culture, with a focus on displaying both traditional culture and contemporary culture to the world.
