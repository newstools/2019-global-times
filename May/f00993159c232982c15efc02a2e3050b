If because of the trade tensions, trade activities (and) trade volumes among countries decrease, then it will impact negatively," said Alisjahbana.In the name of protecting domestic industries, the US has placed steep tariffs on billions of US dollars' worth of products from its major partners, including Canada, China, Japan and the European Union, raising trade tensions around the world and shaking the foundation of the global trading system.In the latest flare-up with China, Washington increased additional tariffs on $200 billion's of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent earlier this month, and has threatened to raise tariffs on more Chinese imports.In response, China has announced that it will raise additional tariffs on a range of US imports from June 1, and "will fight to the end."Beijing has also repeatedly called on the US, which started the row, to get back on the right track as soon as possible and meet China halfway to achieve a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement on the basis of mutual respect.Alisjahbana said she hopes the world's largest two economies will end their trade disputes with a win-win solution soon."I hope this trade (tension) can be resolved, will be resolved soon in a mutually beneficial manner, because directly and indirectly, this trade tension will have impact on the rest of the world and certainly the region," she said.Newspaper headline: Good neighbor Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
