Oil prices increased on Tuesday, as investors kept a close eye on the ongoing political volatility in Venezuela. The tensions, which escalated in the South American country on Tuesday, caused further worries over the country's crude exports and tightening global supply, following US sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday via Twitter that military commanders from all regions and defense areas of the country have "expressed their loyalty to the people, the Constitution and the country." Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez also said earlier on Twitter that "all military units deployed in the eight regions of integral defense report normality in their barracks and military bases, under the command of their natural commanders." Local media published on YouTube images of opposition leader Juan Guaido outside the aviation military base La Carlota, located in Altamira in the east of Caracas. He called on civilians and military to act against the government and urged Maduro to step down.
