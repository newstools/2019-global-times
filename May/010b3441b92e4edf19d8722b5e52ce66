Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Friday that it is the responsibility of the international community to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iranian news agency IRNA reported Friday.Zarif said the world countries should spare no efforts to take the necessary action to protect the JCPOA the way Iran does, if they assume that the deal is a significant achievement.Speaking to IRNA, Zarif said the international community has confined itself to issuing statements or making comments instead of taking a tangible action to protect the JCPOA. He said it was quite evident of what nature a practical action should be, noting that what is needed is the normalization of Iran's economic relations which has been stipulated in the JCPOA.UNSC resolution 2231 exactly refers to this point, therefore it is among the duties of the international community, other JCPOA's members and our friends at the treaty such as China and Russia who mind this achievement to be protected, to take practical measures to benefit Iranian people from the JCPOA's incentive and privileges, he added.Zarif on Friday arrived in Beijing as part of his regional tour and was to meet with China's high-ranking officials on issues of mutual interests along with regional and global developments. Zarif's China trip came after visits to Turkmenistan, India and Japan this week.Japan on Thursday expressed its concern over mounting tensions in the Persian Gulf related to hostilities between the US and Iran over JCPOA.At a meeting with visiting Zarif, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the issue has become increasingly tenser."We are concerned that the situation in the Middle East is getting extremely tense," Abe was quoted as saying at the start of their talks, adding that Japan wanted to continue to maintain and develop amicable ties with Iran.Zarif said that the two countries are very important partners and have traditionally friendly ties. He said it was necessary due to the current situation to discuss with Abe a number of relevant issues.
