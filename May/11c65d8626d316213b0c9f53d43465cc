The company's faulty practices were reported to local police in September 2017.  The International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) issued a Red Notice on Zheng in July 2018, at the request of the Interpol China National Central Bureau.Zheng was arrested by Greek police on August 3 last year in response to the Red Notice, and Chinese police then sent an extradition request to the Greek side through diplomatic channels, which was approved by the Greek side in April. The extradition reflects the resolute attitude of law enforcement organs of China and Greece in fighting crimes and warned fugitives abroad to surrender, the report quoted police as saying.Liang Shuying, a law expert at the China University of Political Science and Law, said that although there is no extradition treaty between China and Greece, the case would be demonstrative for the China-Europe international law enforcement cooperation.Global Times Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
