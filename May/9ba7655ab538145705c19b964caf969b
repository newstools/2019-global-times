China has investigated and dealt with 280,000 cases of violations of the Party's frugality disciplines by the end of March, according to the top anti-graft body of the Communist Party of China (CPC). China has also exposed 5,349 typical cases of frugality violations to warn and educate the public on the subject, according to the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the national supervisory commission. Among the exposed cases, 6,690 officials were found using public funds for banquets or traveling, or accepting bribes, among other misdeeds, according to an online statement. The number of cases showed continuous decline since 2014, but risks of a rebound still exist, the statement said. Festivals and holidays are periods prone to frugality violations, the statement said, adding that unconventional violations were also found, such as officials attending lavish banquets paid by private business owners rather than public money. The CPC released an "eight-point decision" in 2012 to improve Party and government conduct and address the practice of formalities for formalities' sake, bureaucratism, hedonism and extravagance. The top anti-graft body has a monthly reporting system with provincial-level governments, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, central Party and government agencies, centrally administered state-owned enterprises and central financial institutions.
