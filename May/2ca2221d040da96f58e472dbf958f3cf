China's National Health Commission said in April that 53.6 percent of Chinese children and teenagers suffer from myopia. Many places have taken action to deal with the problem. Shandong, another province in East China where the myopia rate among teenagers was nearly 59 percent as of March, reportedly issued a policy to stop related officials from getting promoted within half a year if they fail to lower the myopia rate of children and teenagers in the province by more than 0.5 percentage points per year by 2023.Typical modern habits may be a major factor behind the rise in myopia. These include lack of outdoor activity, long hours of screen time, low levels of sunlight exposure and too many tasks that involve reading.China's Ministry of Education released a notice, announcing a crackdown on online gaming, citing rising levels of myopia, on August 30, 2018. The move was aimed at limiting the number of new online video games and restricting the time youngsters spend playing games.
