At the event, they presented several typical Danish songs and traditional Chinese songs, winning the applause from both Chinese and Danish audiences. The concert started with a welcoming speech by Deputy Head of Mission of the Danish Embassy Helle Meinertz, who gave an introduction of this concert and the choir's visits to China. "The Choir has been an old friend of China and has visited China four times already. The first time was in 1997 and the last time was when they accompanied His Royal Highness Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark for the Expo Shanghai 2010," she said. Meinertz added that personally she is a great fan of choir music since the language of music is universal and lifts the spirit of joy, transcends boundaries and brings people closer together. Founded by the Danish choirmaster Mogens Wöldike in 1924, the choir has since participated in grand performances on many important occasions, including royal events. For their concert tour in China, the choir presented songs for summer and spring in Scandinavia from sunrise to sunset, which brought together a musical fairy tale of the beautiful seasons of light and joy in Scandinavia and are inspired by works of Danish author Hans Christian Andersen.
