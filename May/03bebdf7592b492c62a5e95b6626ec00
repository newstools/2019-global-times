Amid the escalating trade war between China and the US, a Chinese-owned hotel group said on Tuesday that it will hike "tariffs" on US government officials who stay at their hotels.Huangma Jiari, a hotel group based in South China's Hainan Province, said on its official Weibo account that it will begin charging all US government officials a 25 percent service fee."To maintain order and avoid conflict, we suggest US visitors think through whether or not they want to stay in the hotel," Huangma Jiari said.The hotelier has a history of over 20 years, and its cultural-themed destinations usually maintain occupancy rates over 85 percent throughout the year, according to the company's website.Despite the move was considered "unwise and an attention grab" by a few Chinese netizens, some feel it's a reflection of the sentiments associated with "working hard for the country and fighting to the end" which have been spreading online in the face of an escalating trade war with the US.On Monday, China's state broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV) said during the country's most-watched daily news program that China has made comprehensive preparation to a trade war, widely seen by its people as a warning and China's firm stance on trade war.After the broadcast, Xinwen Lianbo topped the search list on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo with over 3.3 billion reads.Â "I think it comes to a time when Chinese have to stand closer and fight through a long-standing trade war, but we're going to do it in a more rational way," Yu Xiaohong, a 25 year old white-collar employee in Beijing told the Global Times on Tuesday."I will stand with my country and support any decision it makes. We can overcome and withstand anything when Chinese come together," Yu said.
