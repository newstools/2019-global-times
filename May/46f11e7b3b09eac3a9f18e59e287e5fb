Chinese dance drama "The Railway to Tibet" returns to the stage of the National Center for the Performing Arts (NCPA) from May 1 to 11, in commemoration of the 70th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China. Produced by NCPA, the drama is themed on the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, which links Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China with the rest of the country. Featuring elements of Tibetan dance, it tells a story of friendship between railway building soldiers and local Tibetans during the railway's construction. The NCPA production made its debut in June 2018 in tribute of the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway started operation on July 1, 2006. It is the world's highest and longest railway built on a plateau.
