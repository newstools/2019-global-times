A symposium examining the legacy of the May Fourth era was held on Sunday in honor of the centenary of May Fourth Movement. The event, organized by the New-York based China Institute, aims to yield a new understanding of the May Forth Movement in China's modern history, and offer new perspectives on the ongoing relevance of the movement to China's present path. William Kirby, Spangler Family Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, delivered a keynote speech entitled "Understanding May Fourth" by reviewing such renowned scholars as Hu Shi, Cai Yuanpei, Mei Yuqi and Chen Yinque, and their pioneer roles in the May Fourth era. "We were highly influenced by Peking University's motto, which is intellectual independence. This motto has been manifesting throughout Chinese history... One of the examples was the May Fourth Movement," Ruth Jin, co-chairwoman of board of directors of Peking University Alumni Association of Greater New York, said in her opening remarks. The May Fourth Movement, which began on May 4, 1919, is widely considered a great patriotic and revolutionary campaign pioneered by advanced young intellectuals and joined by people from all walks of life to resolutely fight imperialism and feudalism. The symposium was co-hosted by the Peking University Alumni Association of Greater New York and New York University China House.
