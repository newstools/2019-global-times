More than 190 art organizations, galleries, and art centers from 20 countries and regions took part. According to statistics from the expo, the number of artworks on display saw a 43 percent increase from 2018 while 80 percent of the participants completed deals, with the highest reaching 5 million yuan ($742,533). In keeping with changes in the Chinese art market, Art Beijing adjusted this year by highlighting photographing arts, printmaking, and other visual arts. Sales at the expo indicate growing enthusiasm for art from the public, as artworks ranging in price from 30,000 to 50,000 yuan performed well. In addition to its routine sections like classic art, contemporary art, design art and public art, this year's Art Beijing also added the Art Beijing Boutique to attract new visitors. The three halls for the expo also hosted seven special programs and seven forums for the event's Design Beijing section. Dong Mengyang, the founder of Art Beijing, commented that since its beginning, Art Beijing was just an expo for contemporary arts, but now it has become a comprehensive expo. "We hope Art Beijing can be both characteristic and pluralistic. No matter if it is the artists or audiences, they can find what they love," he told media.
