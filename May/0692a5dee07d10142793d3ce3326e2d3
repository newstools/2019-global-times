Investigators were on Tuesday pursuing leads that five mysterious deaths, including three by crossbow bolts, may have been a murder-suicide pact among Germans with a reported passion for medieval folklore and weaponry.Police probing the initial triple death said they found the last wills of two of the victims in a hotel room, and no signs of a struggle or involvement of other people.Germany has been baffled by the macabre case since the trio of corpses was found ­Saturday in a hotel in the Bavarian town of Passau, followed by Monday's discovery of two dead women across the country in the town of Wittingen.Mass-circulation Bild ­daily reported that the victims had shared a fascination with the Middle Ages, including knights, jousting, weapons and alchemy.According to an autopsy report, two of the victims in the Passau hotel room - a man named Torsten W., 53, and a woman called Kerstin E., 33 - were found lying in the double bed, hand in hand.They were killed with ­crossbow shots to their heads and hearts, the postmortems found.The last wills of the couple from Rhineland-Palatinate state were also found in the room, police said.The other woman, 30-year-old Farina C., lay on the floor, a single crossbow arrow in her neck - not in her chest, as previously reported.The local prosecutor's office said it was treating the case as a "requested killing and suicide," suggesting Farina C. first shot the couple and then herself.
