A total of 700 people from 44 countries and regions have been testing their skills in automobile technology, electronics, hairdressing, joinery, bakery, bricklaying, plumbing and heating, and others - with a total of 18 categories across a wide range of industries. During the hairdressing competition Tuesday morning, the contestants were asked to design according to a proposition given by the judges, and then cut, style, color and complete their work in 150 minutes. "It is very meaningful to promote international communication in terms of skills," said Abd Halim Jahaya, team leader of the Malaysian contestants. He is especially confident in the category of fashion design and hopes for a good grade for the team. Thousands of visitors, a lot of them college students, came to Chongqing International Expo Center to watch the heated competition on Tuesday.
