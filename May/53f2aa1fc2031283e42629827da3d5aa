China's airlines body said on Friday it supports its members who are seeking compensation from Boeing, as Chinese airlines stand to lose about 4 billion yuan ($578 million) by the end of June over grounded and delayed 737 MAX jets, according to its official statement. As of the end of March, member airlines have operated in total 96 737 Max 8 aircraft, involving China Air, China Southern Airlines, and China Eastern Airlines, the China Air Transport Association said in a statement on Friday. According to the plan, companies are expected to introduce about 130 aircraft, while the 737 Max grounding and delayed delivery have caused significant losses to fleet capacity, affecting airlines' flights and corporate profits. "As the largest customer of 737 Max 8 jets, our losses are also the biggest. Therefore, we support and will help our member airlines seek compensation," the association said. All 13 airlines in China flying 737 Max have asked for compensation from Boeing for the grounding of the aircraft, domestic news site thepaper.cn reported on Friday. More than a dozen Chinese airlines have grounded a total of 96 Boeing 737 MAX planes since March 11, when national authorities ordered domestic airlines to ground the jet after the plane's second deadly crash in Ethiopia, which killed all 257 people on board.
