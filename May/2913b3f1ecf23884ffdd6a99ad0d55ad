Illustrations: Luo Xuan/GTDuring the May Day holiday in China, two trains were found overloaded - leaving some ticket holders stranded. The train from Qingdao to Caoxian, East China's Shandong Province, and the other one from Jiangshan, Zhejiang Province to Huaibei, Anhui Province, were packed beyond capacity, leading to some with tickets being left behind. Some passengers bought short-distance tickets to hop on the trains but did not disembark, so they could travel longer. This led to overcrowding. There are many reasons for trains getting packed during holidays. The demand for travel outstrips the supply - the number of seats available. Moreover, many young people don't buy tickets sufficiently in advance and buy shorter travel tickets closer to the date of journey. They pay for replacement tickets once on the train. Such habit should be discouraged, especially during May Day and National Day holidays. In the interest of fair play, those holding normal tickets in advance deserve to be first on the train.
