Shanghai began construction of the new campus of New York University Shanghai (NYU Shanghai), the first Sino-US higher education institute in China. Located in the New Bund of Pudong District (Qiantan Area), the construction covers more than 110,000 square meters and is expected to be completed by 2022, and can accommodate up to 4,000 undergraduate and graduate students. A 5,000 square meter library as well as laboratories and researching areas covering 7,000 square meters will be built, according to the university. The new campus is about twice as large as the current one in Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone, which is to meet the needs of growing number of students and more diverse lessons, said Yu Lizhong, president of NYU Shanghai. Founded in 2012, NYU Shanghai is regarded as a pilot program in China-US educational cooperation. It now has 1,300 undergraduate and graduate students, about half of whom are international students. Among them, about 60 percent are American students and students from countries along the Belt and Road also account for a large proportion. According to the administration office, the number of applications to NYU Shanghai jumped 25 percent this year to a record high of 16,750 and applicants competed for 450 spots in Fall 2019's freshman class.
