Meng Hongwei, former vice minister of public security, has been indicted for the suspected crime of taking bribes, the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) said Friday. Meng's case has been investigated by the National Supervisory Commission. Upon the designation of the SPP, a procuratorate in Tianjin reviewed the case and filed it in the First Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin. Prosecutors accused Meng of taking advantage of the convenience, power and status generated from his posts to seek benefits for others, illegally accepting vast amounts of money and gifts. The SPP said the prosecutors had informed the defendant of his litigation rights, interrogated him and listened to the defense counsel's opinions. Meng is also the former head of China Coast Guard.
