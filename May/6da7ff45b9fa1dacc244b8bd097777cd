China encourages social organizations and individuals to provide assistance for minors in need of help, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Civil affairs departments and relief institutions for minors across the country should build more public institutions for protecting minors, said Guo Yuqiang, director of the child welfare department of the ministry, at a press conference Monday when expounding on a recently-released guideline on providing care for minors. Governments are called on to purchase services for helping rural children left behind by parents who are migrant workers and children in need of help, including hotline operation, guardianship assessment, family visit and professional training, Guo said. Professionals such as social workers, legal workers and psychological counselors are encouraged to offer assistance to rural left-behind children and needy children, Guo said. Enterprises are required to fulfill their social obligations to assist needy children and their families, and urge employees to perform their duty of guardianship.
