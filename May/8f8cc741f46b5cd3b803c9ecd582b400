Fighting back tears, Theresa May said Friday she would quit, setting up a contest that will install a new British prime minister who could pursue a cleaner break with the EU.May's departure deepens the Brexit crisis as a new leader, who should be in place by the end of July, is likely to want a more decisive split, raising the chances of a confrontation with the EU and potentially a snap parliamentary election.Her voice cracking with emotion, May, who endured crises and humiliation in her failed effort to find a compromise Brexit deal that parliament could ratify, said she would resign on June 7 with a leadership contest beginning the following week."I will shortly leave the job that has been the honor of my life to hold," May said outside her Downing Street official residence. "The second female prime minister, but certainly not the last."I do so with no ill will but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love," said the usually reserved May as she fought back tears.May, once a reluctant supporter of EU membership who won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 Brexit referendum, steps down with her central pledge - to lead the UK out of the bloc and heal its divisions - unfulfilled."It is a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit," she said, adding her successor would have to find a consensus to honor the 2016 referendum result.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said the new prime minister must hold an election to "let the people decide our country's future."May bequeaths a deeply divided country and a political elite that is deadlocked over how, when or whether to leave the EU. The latest deadline for Brexit is October 31.
