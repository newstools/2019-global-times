South Korea's presidential Blue House expressed concern Saturday over North Korea's launches of short-range "projectiles."Blue House spokesperson Ko Min-jung said in a statement that the South Korean government was deeply worried about the launches, which went against the purpose of the inter-Korean comprehensive military agreement.The spokesperson urged Pyongyang to stop such launches that escalate military tensions on the peninsula.The statement came after North Korea fired unidentified short-range projectiles off its east coast Saturday morning.An unnamed South Korean military official was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying the projectiles were not believed to have been ballistic missiles. North Korea is banned from testing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions.Several projectiles were launched toward the northeast from North Korea's east coast city of Wonsan for 21 minutes from about 9:06 am local time on Saturday, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).The projectiles traveled some 70 kilometers to 200 kilometers into the eastern waters. Further details were being analyzed by the military authorities of South Korea and the US.Following the launches, the top national security advisor for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the country's intelligence agency chief and the defense minister gathered at the national crisis management center to closely monitor situations and assess why North Korea fired the projectiles.The military authorities of South Korea and the US currently shared detailed information on the launches, precisely analyzing what type of projectiles were fired, according to the Blue House.The Blue House spokesperson said South Korea paid attention to the launches that came at a time when dialogue on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula came to a lull, calling for North Korea to actively join efforts to rapidly resume the denuclearization negotiations.She added that if necessary, South Korea will closely communicate with neighboring countries.The projectile firings came as the second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump ended with no agreement in late February at the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi.
