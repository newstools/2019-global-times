Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry received on Tuesday a phone call from his US counterpart Mike Pompeo as part of continuous coordination between the two countries, Egyptian Foreign Ministry said. The ministry said in a statement that the two top diplomats discussed means of promoting bilateral relations at all levels in the coming period. They also probed the latest regional developments, particularly the situation in Libya and the Gulf region where the tensions between Iran and the US are rising. The two officials agreed to continue consultation on issues of mutual concern, the statement said. In Washington, the US State Department said Pompeo and Shoukry discussed "the strong US-Egypt partnership, as well as the urgent need to achieve a political solution in Libya and prevent further escalation." They "looked forward to continued bilateral partnership in important regional security issues, including countering Iran's dangerous activities," the department said in a news release. Egypt has been a key regional ally of the United States since the signing of a US-brokered peace treaty with Israel in 1979. The ties between Cairo and Washington, which were cold under former US President Barack Obama, have improved after Donald Trump came to office in the White House in 2017.
