Among the 41 industrial lines, 27 saw higher profits and 14 reported lower earnings in April.On the positive side, consumer product manufacturers and equipment producers maintained relatively fast profit growth, reflecting structural improvement.In the period, major special-purpose equipment producers recorded 17.9-percent profit growth, while electrical machinery and device producers' profits climbed 14.5 percent.The structural change was in line with a shift in China's economic growth drivers from exports and investment to domestic consumption and high-end industries, analysts said.For every 100 yuan ($14.48) of revenue they generated, the costs they bore fell by 1.1 yuan from a year earlier to 88.7 yuan in April.Wang said that manufacturing firms' confidence had been enhanced thanks to the gradual unleashing of policy dividends as a result of the country's lower value-added tax rate.Innovation encouragedIn the long run, innovation will be the main engine to propel the expansion of China's manufacturing industry. To encourage corporate innovation, China unveiled various measures, including establishing a series of innovation centers and laboratories, increasing support for enterprises in key fields and optimizing innovation-oriented policies.Wang said China will place greater emphasis on innovation in enterprises' development and urge them to increase research and development investment with more tax cuts, funding and loan issuances for innovation projects.More efforts will be made to facilitate research on core technologies, accelerate the intelligent, green and service-oriented upgrading of the manufacturing industry, and advance the integrated development of the manufacturing industry and industrial internet, Wang said.While enhancing resource sharing on various research platforms, the country will promote the application of scientific achievements, encourage domestic enterprises to carry out international innovation cooperation and intensify protection of intellectual property.Despite the disruptions from the increased tariffs imposed by the US, Wang said the country's manufacturing industry has bright prospects.Official statistics showed that from January to April, actual foreign investment in China's manufacturing sector jumped 11.4 percent year-on-year.
