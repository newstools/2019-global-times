The Zambian government on Thursday launched a project to address climate change issues in the southern part of the country. The five-year project "Operationalizing the Landscape Approach for Biodiversity Benefits: Policy, Practice and People" is part of the International Climate Initiative funded by the German government and supported by the knowledge-led multi-stakeholder Global Landscape Forum. It aims to reduce emissions, protect biodiversity and alleviate poverty in Zambia's Southern Province, state-run news agency the Zambia News and Information Services quoted Southern Province Permanent Secretary Mwangala Liomba as saying. "This project seeks to enhance the capacity of stakeholders to better identify trade-offs and synergies amongst competing land uses. It will address capacity challenges at the local level in terms of knowledge, conflicting interests and organizational aspects, thereby enhancing landscape sustainability by empowering marginalized groups to participate in decision-making dialogue more effectively," Liomba said at the launch event. The Zambian government called for concerted efforts from all stakeholders to mitigate the effects of climate change and environmental degradation, Liomba said. According to Liomba, the project will contribute to filling knowledge gaps, informing policy alternatives and promoting more sustainable land uses to benefit both the biophysical and social elements in selected districts in the province.
