The Cuban government has legalized private wireless networks and the import of routers and other equipment needed to run them, the state media said Wednesday.The new regulations, which will take effect on July 29, offer a two-year operating license for non-profit non-residential high-speed cable or outdoor wireless networks, for example, for community use.Residential network users do not need to apply for a license for personal use, as long as the network is not-for-profit and does not exceed 300 meters in range.Besides, the regulations allow individuals to connect to government Internet network through state-owned telecommunications company Etecsa.Importing routers and other equipment for wireless technology is also legalized, though users must get prior authorization from the Ministry of Communications.The decision will "contribute to the computerization of society," the ministry said.Prior to the move, Internet access was exclusively provided to a limited number of residents by the government via hotspots at parks and other public spaces.
