Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday condemned a coup attempt in Venezuela after opposition leader Juan Guaido called on a military uprising against President Nicolas Maduro. "As a country which has experienced the negative consequences caused by coups, we condemn the coup bid in Venezuela," Erdogan wrote on his Twitter. The world has to respect the democratic choices of the people in Venezuela, he added. Earlier on Tuesday, opposition leader Juan Guaido, who had proclaimed himself Venezuela's interim president, called on the Venezuelan people and military to take to the streets to overthrow Maduro. "Those who attempt to appoint a postmodern colonial governor to Venezuela, where the people are sovereign and where president comes through elections, should know only democratic elections determined the way to govern the country," Erdogan tweeted. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also said on his Twitter Ankara was against any attempts to change legitimate government through "undemocratic methods." "We are in favour of settling issues through dialogue. We stand by the people of Venezuela," he said.
