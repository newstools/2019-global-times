For French Open women's singles defending champion Simona Halep, any player among top 10 can achieve success this year at Roland Garros. "I would say probably 10 now, because a few of them are very strong, and they had a good season on clay," the women's title holder told a press conference here on Friday. "I think in top 10, any of us, I can include myself, we can win. We will see," added the Romanian. Halep arrived in Paris without a title this year, having lost the final to in-form Kiki Bertens and her first match in Rome to Marketa Vondrousova. "Going to Madrid where is maybe my favorite tournament ... even if I didn't win the final, I felt that my level is very high. "Coming here practicing, I felt really well. But you never know in tennis. I will take day by day," she pointed out. Halep added the pressure as a defending champion is "much better and much easier" compared to winning a slam. "Because I have the title already. It doesn't matter any more what is going to happen," she commented. "Everything comes now comes as a bonus. So I will just try to give my best and see if I'm able to do it again." Halep will kick off title defense against Ajla Tomljanovic of Australia. "She's powerful and hits the ball strong. I have to focus on myself. As I always say, if I am able to do my game, I have a good chance to win," the tournament's third seed noted.
