Chairman Wang Yilin urged company management to prepare for the long term and make shrewd judgment and preparations to ensure the normal operations and sound development of the company, according to a news release on the company website.The CNPC top meeting coincided with a comment made by Fu Chengyu, former chairman of state-owned oil major Sinopec, who said China should prepare for possible short-term termination of crude oil supplies.Sinopec is different from CNPC because of its refining business.Fu also said China should set up an agenda to basically achieve energy self-sufficiency in 10 to 15 years, domestic news site jiemian.com reported on Wednesday.Fu said China should aim to meet more than 80 percent of its energy demand with its own supplies.Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, said that oil is an old industry and China has mastered all the necessary technologies and has alternatives to serve the basic needs of the nation."There are also weak links, such as some of the advanced equipment used in extraction and refining that China can't make at present," Lin told the Global Times on Thursday.Another issue is how to successfully transport Middle East oil to China in  case of a US-inflicted intervention or regional conflict, Lin said. The US has recently escalated the trade war into the sphere of technology by imposing a ban on Huawei, a Shenzhen-based global leader in wireless technologies, suspending supply of vital products and technologies to the company. US-based software providers and international standards organizations have become involved. "The calls (regarding energy) are absolutely correct but are actually not new. However, current events remind China of the sheer need to improve its energy security," noted Lin. CNPC's Wang said special efforts must be made for preventing any disruption in the event that access to key products and services is cut off by foreign suppliers and the company must improve financial risk control. He commented after hearing a briefing on the development of China-US trade friction, China-US oil and gas cooperation and the impact of the trade friction.Wang called for speeding up substitution efforts using domestic alternatives but at the same time vowed to continue to engage in oil and gas cooperation with foreign partners to achieve win-win results. Fu also emphasized international cooperation.The US does offer China a lesson in staging an energy transformation to establish full self-sufficiency, and long-term planning and efforts are sorely needed in China to do this, Lin said.Newspaper headline: Oil sector weighs trade war impact Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Contribution rememberedChild porn arrests shock S.California Chinese communityUtah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental Railroad
