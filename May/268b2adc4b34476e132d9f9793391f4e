"It's a good thing, however, because it has reminded me that we have to change now."The company has adopted a cooperation model with its US partners: Zhongyuan is responsible for original design manufacturing while the US side runs market research and sales, which means that Zhongyuan has little say in business relations."Since last year, we have invested in two automatic production lines, aiming to produce what we want by embracing the intelligent manufacturing trend in the country as well as opportunities emerging from the guidelines of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area," Zhang said.He was confident that by ramping up efforts in self-reliant technological innovation and enhancing the influence of their own brand, the company was bound to survive and thrive even during a trade war."We want to realize a situation where even with tariff hikes, US customers still prefer to choose our products," he said.Newspaper headline: Manufacturing to stride high Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
