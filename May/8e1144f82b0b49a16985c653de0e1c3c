Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi has stressed the need to make utmost effort to increase electricity production, saying that the government has set up new infrastructure for the power system including installation of new cable lines and opening of new sub-power stations. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is also chairperson of the Rural Areas and National Races Development Central Committee, made the remarks at the inaugural ceremony of a 145-megawatt (mw) gas power plant in Belin, Kyaukse township, central Mandalay region Friday, according to local government sources. She expected that about 50 percent of the country's electricity demand will be fulfilled before the end of this year, which will be up from 30 percent in 2016. She revealed the government's target to achieve nationwide electrification by 2025. Of many power plants launched in Mandalay region, the present 145-mw Belin gas power plant has brought the total power produced in the region to 525 mw which will be transmitted not only to Mandalay region but also to the national grid reaching the people in the whole country, Suu Kyi said. Myanmar is meeting just under 50 percent of its electricity demand which is one of the major requirements for the development of the country. She added that power and transport are crucial for the country's development and if the people get access to good transportation and electrification, their social-economic life will improve quickly.
