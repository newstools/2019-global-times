But others stressed the authority of laws and regulations, saying they should not be changed simply because a new phenomenon occurred.Tang was arrested by police in Wuhan in December 2017 for publishing and selling novels identified as illegal because they were not issued by legal publication agencies and did not have an issue number, Chutian Metropolis Daily reported.Tang's five books contain lewd depictions of gay sex, the report said. Tang has reportedly earned 1.18 million yuan ($170,692) from these illegal publications.Whether books make a profit is the key in the sentence, Lü Xiaoquan, a Beijing-based lawyer told the Global Times on Monday. "For books published for scientific research or public benefit, the court should give a lesser punishment," he said.
