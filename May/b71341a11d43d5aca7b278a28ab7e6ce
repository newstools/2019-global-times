The Saudi-led coalition's warplanes launched airstrikes on a military airport in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa on Wednesday, residents said. Nearly 10 airstrikes hit al-Dailamy military air base in the night, they said. The air base is located in the northern part of Sanaa, near a civil airport. Both airports have been closed since the coalition imposed air siege on the Iran-allied Houthi rebels in late 2016. There were no reports of casualties or comments yet by the coalition. The Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen's war in March 2015 to support internationally-recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after Houthi rebels forced him into exile and seized much of the country's north, including Sanaa.
