To capitalize on the events, the Swiss Federal Council has decided in a recent meeting to promote Switzerland in China through this platform, according to the Swiss Embassy in China on May 1. As part of a one-year campaign beginning in 2021, the House of Switzerland (HoS), which is a mobile exhibit of Swiss design, will travel to various cities across China to showcase the diversity of Switzerland with partners from business, tourism, science and culture. The campaign in China aims to further deepen bilateral ties. In order to maximize impact, the HoS will travel to several major cities in China in 2021 as part of an accompanying campaign titled "House of Switzerland on Tour" before it is set up for the Winter Olympic games in Beijing and Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, where it will serve as a Swiss venue for activities such as medal celebrations, media conferences, receptions and other promotional activities. In collaboration with partners from the private and public sectors, HoS will serve as a communication and networking platform to showcase Switzerland's economic and technological capabilities and promote Swiss companies in China, the country's foremost trading partner in Asia.
