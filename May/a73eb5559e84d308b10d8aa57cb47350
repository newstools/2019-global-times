It was the first city commercial bank to be taken over by regulators in almost 20 years.As overly aggressive deleveraging could pose risks to the economy. Zhou said China's monetary policy must be kept moderately loose to maintain adequate liquidity to hedge against uncertainties from the trade war and give the country's banks more time to reduce NPLs. "The supply-side structural reform should proceed cautiously and prudentially, and we should continue strengthening the economic fundamentals to prolong the growth momentum," said Zhou.During the high-level forum, another report that also focuses on China's financial policies - China Financial Policy Report 2019 - was also released. The annual report, which has been published since 2011, was presented jointly by the China Center for Financial Research of Tsinghua University and the Institute of Financial Policy of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The report pointed out several dilemmas faced by Chinese policymakers in 2018-2019: how to achieve a trade-off between tight regulation, which may expose financial risks, and adding leverage, which may hike future risks.Lu Lei, deputy administrator of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, while releasing the report at the forum, suggested that China should develop direct financing markets and continue financial supply-side reform to resolve the dilemma."In direct financing, capital seekers and providers directly build credit contracts via financial tools such as bonds and stock rights, which are highly liquid," whereas in indirect financing, banks act as middle men, Lu said.  "Developing direct financing could serve the real economy and boost the virtuous cycle of financial stability," Lu noted.
