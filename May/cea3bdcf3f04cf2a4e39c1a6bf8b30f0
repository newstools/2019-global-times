The key areas of investment in 2019 are likely to be focused on new infrastructure sectors and other new economic sectors based on cutting-edge technologies in the current critical phase of China's industrial upgrading and the slowdown of the world economy, according to an investment report.Specific sectors including high-speed railway construction, information and communication infrastructure represented by 5G, advanced manufacturing and intelligent fields would be the core of long-term investment, according to the Annual Report on the Development of China's Investment released by China Jianyin Investment (JIC) in Beijing on Wednesday.In terms of geography, the report suggested that innovation elements gathering cities and China's southern new economic areas deserve more attention from capital markets, adding that the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) keeps providing more investment opportunities in countries and regions along the routes.According to a study by the China Center for International Economic Exchanges issued on Tuesday, the internal trade value of the BRI region has surpassed the North American Free Trade Area to become the world's second-largest trade entity only after the EU, and has topped the list of foreign investment destinations.Investment is the basic driving strength of economic growth and China's economy has long been led by investment, said the JIC report. Downward pressure on China's economy will continue to accelerate in 2019, and at the same time, world economic growth is also facing a declining situation. Steady investment would be the key to stabilize economic growth, the report noted.The total investment in fixed assets was recorded around 64.4 trillion yuan ($9.5 trillion), Zhang Liqun, analyst of Development Research Center of the State Council, said at the press conference Wednesday.In 2019, the growth rate of China's fixed-asset investment is forecast to pick up to above 6 percent, and the critical move to stabilize investment is to stabilize infrastructure construction. Growth in infrastructure investment is expected to rebound to 8 percent in 2019, said the report. Newspaper headline: Investment opportunities lie in new infrastructure, high-end industries: report Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
