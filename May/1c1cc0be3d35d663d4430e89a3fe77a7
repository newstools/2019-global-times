The draft rules are open for public comment until June 28.Specifically, the draft regulation states that companies cannot route domestic internet traffic outside the country. Operators should also assess potential security risks and seek permission from regulators before publishing, sharing, transacting or providing important data to the outside world, it said.The regulation said that companies should provide data to relevant government agencies when approached by them for national security, social management, economic regulation and other duties.  Such a move is necessary for China to safeguard its national security and in line with similar practices adopted by other major powers, including the US, Russia and the EU, said Liang Haiming, dean of Hainan University's Belt and Road Research Institute.US officials have demanded data from internet companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter under national security grounds. The infamous Prism program of the US National Security Agency also showed that US officials had direct access to data from internet companies. In Australia, a new law directly demands that internet firms must open what's known as a backdoor for Australian security forces to access encrypted data. The draft rules also shows China's firm stance on matters of national security despite pressure from the US in stalled trade talks, analysts said. US officials had reportedly pressured Chinese officials for concessions in granting US firms access to China's cloud computing market and relaxing restrictions on data storage.The move could also be an effective way to counter the US' intensifying crackdown against Huawei, particularly after US companies such as Google decided to follow a US ban to cut supplies to Huawei, according to Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based internet analyst.The new rules, which were published in line with the cybersecurity law, are aimed at bolstering protection of China's national security in line with the rule of law. But in light of the US crackdown on Huawei, it could also be a tool for Chinese officials to counter the US, analysts said.Newspaper headline: China drafts tighter data storage rules Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
