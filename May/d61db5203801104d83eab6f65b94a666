The quality of China's listed companies and the healthy growth of the nation's economy will lend firm support to the A-share stock market, which will rise in the long term despite short-term fluctuations due to the impact of the prolonged trade war, officials and industry insiders said.
Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), in a rare case after being named as the head of the agency more than 100 days ago, commented over the weekend to ease market concerns on the recent volatility."In the long run, the trend of China's stock market is determined by such factors as the quality of listed companies and China's economic fundamentals," Yi said at an annual gathering of the China Association for Public Companies in Beijing, while noting that the market has experienced "certain fluctuations" due to external factors.
China's stock market had a roller-coaster ride last week amid global uncertainties. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 4.7 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 index slumped 4.5 percent last week, touching nearly 3-month lows.  
While some cited the trade row between China and the US as a key factor, observers said that the dispute might be a disruptive factor for the A-share markets, but it won't be a deciding factor. 
"It won't change the recovery trend of the domestic stock markets," Li Daxiao, chief economist at Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities, told the Global Times on Sunday. 
According to Li, market fundamentals signal ample scope for further gains. "Many A-share stocks have relatively low valuations. The proportion of overseas investment capital in A-share markets is also low considering the large market capitalization of the two Chinese mainland bourses, which means that incremental overseas capital will flow into A shares on a large scale in the future," he said. 
Blue chips will surge and even set price records, Li predicted.
Rising returns to investors also signal the improved quality of A-share listed companies. Last year, 2,787 companies distributed dividends with a total value of 1.15 trillion yuan ($168.5 billion) to investors, according to Yi. 
That translated to a dividend yield of 2.41 percent, roughly equal to that of the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The yield was 1.85 percent in 2014. 
Yi said that the quality of listed companies is the foundation of the nation's capital market, which serves as a barometer of China's real economy.
Officials and industry insiders are also optimistic on economic growth, which they said will promote the sound development of China's capital market and optimization of listed companies.  
"Judging from the 6.4 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, as well as the fact that the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in the expansion sector (above 50 percent) for two consecutive months in March and April, the downward economic trend has been curbed," Li said. 

During the meeting, Yi vowed to step up oversight of listed companies, with a focus on corporate governance such as information disclosure and internal controls, so as to improve the quality of listed companies. 
"Listed companies and major shareholders must guard against four bottom lines: no fraudulent disclosures, no insider trading, no stock manipulation and no actions that harm the interests of listed companies,�?Yi said.
