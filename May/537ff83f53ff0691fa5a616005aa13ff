The US is abusing the power of its government and deliberately discrediting and suppressing specific companies, which proves neither of glory nor justice, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday in responding to reports that US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order to ban Chinese technology giant Huawei. "We urge the US side to stop cracking down on Chinese companies by using security excuses and to provide a fair and unprejudiced business environment," Geng Shuang, spokesperson of the ministry, told a press briefing on Wednesday. Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week barring US companies from using telecoms equipment made by companies that pose a national security risk, paving the way for a ban on doing business with Huawei, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing three US officials familiar with the matter.Huawei spokesperson did not immediately comment on the reports. However, David Wang, executive director and chairman of the company's investment review board, told an event Wednesday in Beijing that some countries have confused technical issues with ideological issues. Network security is not a political issue, it is in fact a technical issue that should be addressed by cooperating on a broader scale, he noted. "Labeling a country or a company in relation to national security will not help tackle global network security challenges," Wang said. The company has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or that it poses a risk to the national security of other countries.
