South Korea will push for 8 million US dollars of humanitarian aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) through international organizations, Seoul's unification ministry said Friday. The ministry said in a statement that the government decided to push for the provision of 8 million dollars to humanitarian aid projects of international organizations, including the World Food Program (WFP) and the UNICEF, for babies and pregnant women in the DPRK. The contribution would be made under the position that South Korea will continue humanitarian assistance for the DPRK people irrespective of political situations, the ministry noted. The government of South Korean President Moon Jae-in announced a plan in 2017 to provide 8 million dollars of aid for the DPRK through international organizations, but it had been halted on international sanctions against Pyongyang. The last South Korean food aid to the DPRK happened in 2010 when 5,000 tons of rice was delivered to the north. The ministry said the South Korean government will review concrete food aid plans for the DPRK, such as a direct assistance to the DPRK or an indirect aid through international organizations, after sufficiently collecting public opinion.
