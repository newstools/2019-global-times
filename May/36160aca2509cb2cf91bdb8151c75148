The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Libya's General Authority of Sports and Youth signed an agreement to support Libya's youth programs, UNICEF said later Thursday. "UNICEF and General Authority of Sports and Youth have signed a two-year work plan to support youth programs," UNICEF said in a statement. "During 2019-2020 ambitious adolescents and young girls and boys will receive transformational leadership and innovative thinking trainings to set-up social enterprises in 24 municipalities," the statement said. UNICEF and the Libyan Ministry of Education on Tuesday signed an agreement to provide education for children affected by the armed conflict in the country. Amid years of armed conflict and political instability, Libyan authorities have been struggling to meet the needs of the young people, mainly by providing employment opportunities and proper education. Libya has been suffering escalating violence and political instability ever since the fall of late leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
