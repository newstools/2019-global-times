Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday spoke over phone with US Vice President Mike Pence, according to the prime minister office. Trudeau raised the issue of US steel and aluminum tariffs and stressed the importance of their removal. They also exchanged views on the ratification of the new North American Free Trade Agreement, a news release from the office said. The agreement was signed last November by the three countries, but it does not take effect until it is ratified, which none has done. On May 31, 2018, the United States announced that tariffs of 25 percent on imports of Canadian steel and 10 percent on imports of Canadian aluminum would take effect on June 1, 2018. In response to the unprecedented tariffs, Canada immediately announced countermeasures to impose tariffs on a range of American goods imported into Canada, including a 25 percent tariff on American-made steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum.
