A prototype high-speed maglev train with a top speed of 600 kilometers (km) per hour rolled off the assembly line in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province on Thursday, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The step marked a major breakthrough in the field of high-speed maglev technology, the one-paragraph Xinhua report said.The maglev train is equipped with the world's first traction drive system with a maximum power of 24 mega volt-amperes (24 MVA), a source who asked to remain anonymous at CRRC Qingdao Sifang Rolling Stock Research Institute Co, told the Global Times on Thursday.MVA is a unit of measure used for the apparent power in an electrical circuit.The institute designed the traction and control systems of the newly assembled maglev train.The electrical operation control system and communication system are designed to be suitable for long trunk lines, and they will operate autonomously, said the source. With the new systems, the maglev train will have no risk of derailments or rear-end collisions.The technical breakthrough proves China's research and development ability in high-speed maglev field, Zhao Jian, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, told the Global Times on Thursday. The high-speed maglev prototype is scheduled to roll out in 2020 and a comprehensive system test will be carried out in 2021 to complete the integrated verificationChina has been pursuing maglev technology since the first decade of this century and is a leading country in terms of maglev mileage.A maglev line has linked Shanghai's Pudong airport with the city center since 2006 on a 30-km-long track, using German technology. The service, with a top speed of 300 kms per hour, had safely carried 50 million passengers as of September 2017. Zhuzhou in Central China's Hunan Province and Beijing have low-speed maglev lines in service.The prototype high-speed train will be a vital part in mastering the design, manufacturing, testing and evaluation process for obtaining proprietary maglev technology, according to the WeChat account tieluguancha.High-speed maglev trains will ideally fit into the modern travel pattern in China, which is dominated by high-speed trains running at 350 km per hour and jets travelling at 800 km per hour, the report said.The maglev trains will be the fastest way of traveling distances of up to 1,500 kms, the outlet reported, citing an expert.They can greatly improve urban commuting efficiency, and promote the integration of urban and rural areas, according to the Bandao City Daily based in Qingdao, which cited an expert.Zhao warned, however, of potential challenges in commercialization of maglev trains. "It can take years to yield economic returns," he added.
