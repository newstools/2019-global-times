The report said the red mud containing alumina waste is transported by the pipeline from the factory to the dam.The government said that it has asked a quality assessment department to evaluate the dam quality, investigate the causes of water seepage and the degree of the aluminum oxide liquefaction, monitor water and soil samples, and take preventive measures.Residents near the factory and the dam are worried about the pungent odor, Li Xiaogang, a local villager, told the Global Times on Thursday."My two children got rashes and easily caught a cold. They were diagnosed with lead poisoning and started to receive medication last year," said Li. Li could not provide any hospital certificate.Liu Yuemin, another resident who lives in the lower reaches of the dam, told the Global Times that there were rashes on his head and his wife's face. They have had this symptom since 2017, and it is getting worse each year.Two local residents told the Global Times on Thursday that the authorities had promised to give them resettlement subsidies and other compensation during the authorities' investigation, but that they still had concerns over the pollution.Liu noted that the compensation the authorities promised was far from enough and they did not offer any place to settle down or arrange any medical examination.Challenged by the situation, the local government promised to launch a comprehensive campaign across the county to eliminate safety and environmental hazards to ensure the safety of people's lives and property, said the announcement.According to the open archive, the mud would cause serious water pollution and soil pollution, and the dust from the mud would pollute the air as well. Also, the red mud is corrosive and irritating which could cause burns to the human body.Alumina dust over the long term can cause lung diseases. In the early stages symptoms could be cough, burnout, and weakness, while in the later stages it could lead to emphysema, pulmonary infection, or tuberculosis, according to a statement provided to the Global Times by the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a Beijing-based non-profit organization. However, the company denied with the Beijing News that the dam cracked and neither did the mud enter the river. The company has been at the forefront of the aluminum industry in recent years, and environmental issues always come with the production of alumina and electrolytic aluminum, the National Business Daily quoted an anonymous expert in the aluminum industry on Thursday.The company was ordered 15 times since 2012 by environmental authorities to improve on issues such as poor organized emissions of industrial dust and the poor disposal of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), according to a list on the IPE website.
