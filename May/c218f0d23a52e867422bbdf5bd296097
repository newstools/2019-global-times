Hyundai is to recall 6,620 imported vehicles in China over defective engine software, according to China's market regulator. The recall, which will start on June 17, involves part of the imported Veloster vehicles manufactured between April 5, 2012, and August 28, 2014, the company said in a statement filed to the State Administration for Market Regulation. Some vehicle engines burn ahead of normal ignition due to the defects in the design of the engine management software, which may damage engines or cause the engines to stall. The company will upgrade the engine management software for the recalled vehicles free of charge to eliminate safety risks, it said.
