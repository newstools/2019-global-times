For example, it supports a local data mode with the internet off, and private cloud deployment," DJI said, noting it gives its customers full and complete control of how data is collected, transmitted and stored.US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Monday that Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government, CNN reported. The DHS did not name any specific manufacturer, but nearly 80 percent of drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, the report said.The US move caused an uproar in China, with many calling it yet another evil move of the US government to attack Chinese hi-tech companies following the Huawei case."Similar to the ban on Huawei, the US accusation against Chinese-made drones is groundless; and it will eventually hurt the US' own drone market," Shi Yinhong, director of Renmin University of China's Center for American Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday.A 2018 market sector report from industry analyst Skylogic Research said 80 percent of drones operating in the US and Canada and about three-fourths globally are made by DJI, CNN reported.Faced with constant provocations from the US, Shi warned that China should implement relevant countermeasures based on its own capabilities and national interests.
