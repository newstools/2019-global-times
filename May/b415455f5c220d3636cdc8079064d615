Ukraine will host the spring session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in 2020, the Ukrainian parliament press service said. A decree to host the session on May 22-25, 2020 in Kiev was signed by Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Andriy Parubiy, said a statement on the Ukrainian parliament website. In October 2017, NATO approved Ukraine's bid to hold the spring session of the assembly. Last month the Ukrainian parliament adopted the decree on hosting the session. Founded in 1955, the assembly serves as a consultative inter-parliamentary body of NATO member states, associate countries and observer delegations. Its sessions are held twice a year in different countries. Ukraine, though not a NATO member, closely cooperates with the alliance and participates in the latter's Partnership for Peace Program. In February, the Ukrainian parliament passed a constitutional amendment stating Ukraine's commitment to joining NATO.
