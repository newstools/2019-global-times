Indian demand for gold is seen rising in April-June quarter due to traditional wedding season, after it grew by 5 percent to 159 tons in January-March over the corresponding period last year, a release by World Gold Council said Thursday. By value, the demand in the first quarter grew by 13 percent to 6.76 billion US dollars over the corresponding quarter last year. Of the total demand of 159 tons by volume, 125.4 tons was attributed to jewelry while the balance 33.6 tons was on account of investment demand. "The strengthening of the rupee and the fall in local gold prices towards the later part of the quarter triggered a rise in India's gold demand. Looking ahead, demand is likely to be boosted in Q2, due to traditional wedding season buying, the Akshaya Tritiya festival and rising crop prices," Somasundaram PR, Managing Director of World Gold Council(India) said. Going by the normal monsoon predicted this year, which augurs well for the rural economy and gold, we estimate India's gold demand to be positively impacted in 2019 and be in the range of 750 to 850 tons in 2019, he said. In 2018, India's gold consumption stood at 760.4 tons. Gold recycled in India during the first quarter stood at 16.1 tons as compared to 14.1 tons in the corresponding quarter last year, the release said.
