Sudan's army rulers and protest leaders said more talks were planned for Monday on finalizing the makeup of a new ruling body, after hours of negotiations through the night ended without agreement.Both sides have been at loggerheads over the new governing body that would rule Sudan for a three-year transitional period after the ouster last month of former president Omar al-Bashir.The latest discussions were launched Sunday evening following pressure from world powers to install a civilian-led governing body - a key demand of demonstrators.After continuing into the early hours of Monday, the ruling military council announced the talks would resume at 9 pm."The structure of the sovereign authority has been discussed," Lieutenant General Shamseddine Kabbashi, spokesman of the military council, told reporters."It's agreed to resume negotiations today [Monday] evening... hoping to reach a final deal."The Sudanese Professional Association - the group that initially launched the protest campaign against Bashir in December, said Monday that it was in no rush to finalize the deal."We are not in a hurry for the crucial victory... whatever be the outcome, it will be a step forward," it wrote on Twitter without elaborating.The agreement had been expected on Wednesday, but the military council suspended the negotiations for 72 hours.Ahead of Sunday's talks, the umbrella protest movement - the Alliance for Freedom and Change - raised the ante by insisting that the country's ruling body be "led by a civilian as its chairman and with a limited military representation."The existing military council is headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the generals insist that the overall new body be military-led.On the eve of the talks, hundreds of supporters of Islamist movements rallied outside the presidential palace in Khartoum warning they would reject any deal that would exclude sharia - Islamic law - from the country's political roadmap."The main reason for the mobilization is that the alliance is ignoring the application of sharia in its deal," said Al-Tayieb Mustafa, who heads a coalition of about 20 Islamic groups.
