Fourteen state governors of Brazil on Tuesday published an open letter opposing a presidential decree to relax gun possession restrictions in the South American country. They said they believe relaxing gun control will not help curb violence in the country, but lead to even a higher level, while urging an immediate revocation of the decree issued earlier this month by President Jair Bolsonaro. At the same time, the governors called for government efforts towards "an effective and responsible policy for the control of arms and ammunition in the country." "The measures proposed by the decree will not contribute to making our states safer. On the contrary: they will have a negative impact on containing violence, increasing, for example, the amount of guns and ammunition to supply criminals and the risk that arguments and fights between ordinary citizens end up in tragedy," the governors said in the letter. The presidential decree allows a significant increase in the number of gun models available to ordinary citizens, and in the amount of bullets they can buy annually. Local media reports warned that the decree, with licensing purchase of even automatic rifles, would make easier the gun purchase by drug gangs as many of the young dealers do not have police records. The governors are not alone in questioning the presidential decree to ease gun laws. The decree's suspension has been appealed for by federal prosecutors' office, in addition to at least three lawsuits filed in the supreme court.
