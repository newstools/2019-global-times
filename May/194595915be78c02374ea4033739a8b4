The cross-party discussions over Brexit on Friday ended without any agreement six weeks after they started. The British Opposition Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May that talks with the government to find a compromise over Brexit "have gone as far as they can". He said talks could not carry on because of "the increasing weakness and instability" of the government. The latest development came one day after May promised to set a timetable for leaving Downing Street following a Parliament vote on the Withdraw Agreement Bill -- the legislation needed to implement her deal -- next month.
