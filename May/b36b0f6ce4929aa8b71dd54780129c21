Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn on Saturday completed Buddhist and Brahmin rituals to symbolically transform him into a living god as the Southeast Asian nation crowned its first monarch in nearly seven decades.The coronation of King Vajiralongkorn, 66, took place inside the Grand Palace throne hall in Bangkok after a period of official mourning for his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in October 2016 having reigned for 70 years.Chinese President Xi JinpingÂ congratulated King Maha Vajiralongkorn on Saturday.The king is an old friend of the Chinese people and has been attending to and supporting the cause of friendship between the two countries for long, Xi said in the message."I attach great importance to the development of China-Thailand relations and stand ready to make joint efforts with you to carry forward the traditional China-Thailand friendship, deepen cooperation in building the Belt and Road jointly, and push forward the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries to make bigger headway," Xi said.The king was joined by new Queen Suthida after a surprise announcement three days before the coronation that the thrice-divorced monarch had married for a fourth time.His coronation comes amid the uncertainty of an unresolved election battle between the current military junta chief and a "democratic front" trying to push the army out of politics."I shall continue, preserve, and build upon the royal legacy and shall reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the people forever," the king said in his first royal command, while sitting under a nine-tiered umbrella in full royal regalia including a gold-enameled, diamond-tipped crown.
