Photo: ICThe Beijing Internet Court Tuesday required a live broadcast platform to pay 30,000 yuan ($4347) as compensation to mother of a star rooftopper, who died in November 2017 while taking live of extreme sports, as the platform failed to perform the supervision responsibility to videos of risky content."I must be the craziest rooftoping guy, as I risk my life every day," said Wu Yongning, who fell off a building during his last rooftopping challenge in Changsha, capital of Central China's Hunan Province. Wu took live broadcast on Huajiao - the live broadcast platform - of almost every challenge.The court ruled that internet service providers are to some extend obliged to protect users' safety. Moreover, in this case, Huajiao shared the earning of Wu's videos, which makes the platform responsible for Wu's safety. Wu's mother, surnamed He, blamed Huajiao for having not discouraged Wu from taking such life-risking videos.Wu had millions of followers on social media, and his ascent videos earned him 55,000 yuan ($8,753) on an online platform in addition to lucrative sponsorship deals, according to The Beijing News.But Huajiao failed to fulfill its responsibility after  knowing what Wu did in the video was dangerous but had not take any measures to remove or shield the videos. However, Huajiao said  that, as an internet service for information storage, it is impossible for them to interfere with Wu's personal freedom; nor did they have the obligations to deal with Wu's videos that did not contain illegal contents. The platform argued it did not constitute an act of harm nor did it encourage Wu to challenge the sports beyond his ability, although the platform admitted it had promoting cooperation with Wu. It is not reported that whether Huajiao would appeal or not.
