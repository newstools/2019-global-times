Chinese enterprises will play a major role amid the country's innovative efforts to solve shortages of core technologies, an official said Friday. China, focusing on key links of the industrial chain with breakthroughs in tech-innovation, will guide and encourage enterprises to strengthen R&D and application promotion, Wang Zhijun, Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology, said at a routine press conference of the State Council. With market mechanisms combined with the role of the government, the market will play a decisive role in guiding technological R&D, selecting technological route and allocating various innovative elements, Wang said. At the same time, the country is set to create a fair market environment for competition in the innovative sector, according to Wang. China will further establish and improve the support system for basic research to enhance original innovative abilities, by increasing central financial support and guiding more investments into basic fields, Wang said.
