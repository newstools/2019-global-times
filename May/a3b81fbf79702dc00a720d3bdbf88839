"Taiwan independence" goes against the historical tide and is a road to nowhere, a Chinese mainland spokesperson said Tuesday. An Fengshan, spokesperson with the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, made the comment in response to an earlier meeting between Taiwan's security chief and US national security adviser. The one-China principle is a widely-recognized norm governing international relations and the political foundation for China-US relations, said An. Any remarks and actions that undermine the one-China principle are tantamount to shaking the foundation of China-US relations and are against the fundamental interests of the two countries, An said, adding that China strongly opposes such dangerous behaviors. "We sternly warn Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party administration that relying on foreigners to build oneself up is doomed to fail and one will certainly pay a price for such deeds," An said.
