Villagers in Xiejiacun, East China's Anhui Province, are seen wrapping black tea bags with bamboo or reed leaves on Wednesday to fill rapidly increasing online orders. When Xu Yuehong, 55, got the idea to make such tea bags as gifts for friends in 2016, she did not expect them to become such a hit just a short time after her daughter helped her to start a small business online. Orders reached 200,000 in 2018, and stand at 150,000 so far this year.
