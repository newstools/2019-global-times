Qinghai Lake, China's largest inland salt lake, has seen over 30,000 water birds, with some starting to breed, the local nature reserve's administration said. Based on a six-day bird monitoring operation that covered over 1,300 km around the lake in late April, the monitoring staff observed 48 species of water birds totaling 31,351 in number, 11,000 more compared with the same period in 2018, said He Yubang, head of the administration. The observed birds included state first-class protected black-necked cranes and black storks, and state second-class protected white spoonbill and whooper swan. He said water birds entered breeding season in late April. In some habitats, birds have finished nesting. Qinghai Lake is an important ecological barrier in northern China and a key stop for migrant birds from Central and East Asia.
