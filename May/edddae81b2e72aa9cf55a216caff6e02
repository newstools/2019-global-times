US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to arrive in Brussels late Monday morning, the top diplomat of the European Union (EU) said. "We were told during the night that he was planning to change his travel plans and to have a stopover here in Brussels. He is expected, I think, to land in the late morning," said Federica Mogherini, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, upon arrival at the EU's Foreign Affairs Council. "We will be here all day with a busy agenda (of the EU's Foreign Affairs Council) so we will see during the day how and if we manage to arrange a meeting, he is always welcome, obviously, but there are no precise plans for the moment," Mogherini added. Mogherini did not elaborate on Pompeo's agenda in Brussel. During last week's trip of Europe, which did not include a stop in Brussels, Pompeo cut short his trip twice, cancelling visits to Germany and Greenland.
