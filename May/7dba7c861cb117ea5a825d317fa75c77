Chinese students from Israeli universities on Friday held poetry recitation concert to mark the centenary of the May Fourth Movement in China in the Chinese Culture Center in central Israel's Tel Aviv city. They expressed their deep patriotism by reciting poetry and essays, performing music and singing songs. The concert was organized by Israel Chinese Students and Scholars Association and the Culture and Education Office of Chinese Embassy in Israel. It is also one of the events to mark the 70th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China this year. It is of great significance to hold the poetry recitation concert, said Dai Yuming, Minister Counselor with the Chinese Embassy in Israel. Through such events, Chinese young people could remember history and carry forward the May Fourth spirit, Dai said, adding that they could make their contribution to the economic and social development of China after they graduate. Jiao Sida, a Chinese student from Bar-Ilan University, told Xinhua that she expected to return to China after graduation and contribute her youth to the motherland. The May Fourth Movement started with mass student protests on May 4, 1919 against the government's weak response to the Treaty of Versailles that imposed unfair treatment on China and undermined the country's sovereignty after World War I. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, May 4 was formally designated as China's Youth Day.
