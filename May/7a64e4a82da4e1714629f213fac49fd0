Chinese authorities will improve urban public transportation operation mechanisms and strengthen safety guarantee, according to the Ministry of Justice. According to a draft regulation released by the ministry on Friday to solicit public opinions, urban public transportation management departments should carry out surveys to learn about the public's needs and optimize public transit routes. The prices of public transit tickets should be set by the government, the regulation says. The regulation asks urban public transportation enterprises to assume the main responsibility of ensuring safety production and establish corporate safety management systems. The regulation requires that urban public transportation management departments and enterprises take necessary measures to guarantee operation safety in case of natural disasters, emergencies and mass transit facility malfunctions. City governments are encouraged to promote the application of new technology, energy and equipment in building smart urban public transportation. The draft is open for public opinion until June 10.
