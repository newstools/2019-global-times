Hung Hsiu-chu, former chairperson of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) party, attended a symposium in Beijing Monday on relations across the Taiwan Strait and national rejuvenation. Liu Jieyi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, was also present at the symposium. Participants raised several joint proposals, calling on compatriots on both sides of the Strait to work together and achieve national rejuvenation. They also called for consolidating the political foundation of the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing "Taiwan independence." The two sides should deepen integrated development, enhance grassroots exchanges, expand sales of farm produce and fishery products from Taiwan on the mainland, and step up tourism cooperation, according to the participants. They also agreed that the two sides should encourage exchanges between young people, and expand cultural exchanges.
