Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday was set to meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the highest-level talks between the rival powers in nearly a year as they see if they can make headway on a raft of disagreements from Venezuela to Iran to arms control.Pompeo was set to visit Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi less than two weeks after US President Donald Trump voiced optimism about improving relations with Moscow during a more than one-hour telephone conversation with the Russian leader.The new diplomatic push followed the long-awaited report in the US by investigator Robert Mueller which found that the Trump campaign did not collude with Moscow, partially lifting a cloud that had hung over the mogul-turned-president for two years.Putin was expected to receive Pompeo Tuesday evening after the US secretary of state holds talks with Moscow's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov."My meetings in Russia will highlight a number of important topics," Pompeo tweeted on Tuesday."On some issues we may agree, on others we may disagree, but when it's in our national interests, it is our responsibility to find a way forward."Pompeo is the highest-ranking US official to see Putin since July when Trump met him in Helsinki.Despite Trump's conciliatory attitude toward Putin, Washington and Moscow are at loggerheads on an array of urgent strategic questions, including the Venezuelan crisis, Iran, the Syrian civil war and the conflict in Ukraine.Â At a meeting Monday evening, Putin stressed that Russia was developing hypersonic weapons and tasked his top brass with also developing defenses against such weapons.The Trump administration earlier this year pulled out of another key arms control agreement, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, with NATO allies saying a Russian missile system was in violation. Moscow has denied the claims.The Venezuela crisis is expected to be another key point of contention.The US has been trying for more than three months to topple Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and Pompeo has repeatedly blamed Russia for giving him a lifeline.Trump has, however, contradicted Pompeo, saying the Russian president assured him that Moscow is not involved in Venezuela.Pompeo cancelled a stop in Moscow scheduled for Monday to meet with European foreign ministers in Brussels, who have been uncomfortable with the hawkish direction of the US, especially on Iran.The US has pulled out of a nuclear deal backed by the Europeans, Russia and China and instead has slapped sweeping sanctions on Iran in an all-out effort to curb Tehran's regional clout.Russia's Lavrov said he would have a "frank conversation" with Pompeo on Iran.
