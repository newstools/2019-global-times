China said Tuesday it hopes that relevant country can do more things conducive to strengthening the mechanism of international arms control and safeguarding international and regional peace and stability. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang made the comments after US President Donald Trump announced on April 26 that the United States was withdrawing from the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which regulates international trade in conventional arms and seeks to prevent and eradicate illicit trade and diversion of conventional arms by establishing international standards governing arms transfers."We hope that relevant country can do more things conducive to strengthening the mechanism of international arms control and safeguarding international and regional peace and stability," Geng said at a daily press briefing. Calling ATT an important multilateral treaty in the field of conventional arms control, Geng said that China supports the international community taking necessary measures in setting standards for international trade of arms and cracking down on illegal transfer and trafficking of arms. China supports the purpose and goals of the ATT, and has been attending relevant conferences as an observer, Geng said, adding China has been considering joining the treaty.
