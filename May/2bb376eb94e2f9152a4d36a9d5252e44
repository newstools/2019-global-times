EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Monday underlined the need for resumption of political dialogue in Libya. Mogherini made her remarks during a meeting with UN-backed Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Serraj in the Belgian capital of Brussels, according to a statement issued by the EU delegation to Libya. "Mogherini reiterated that the EU expects all parties and regional players to immediately cease their military activities and re-start political dialogue, in the interest of all Libyans," the statement said. The European official also stressed the importance of the civilians' access to humanitarian aid as well as the protection of civilians and immigrants in the Libyan detention centers. The east-based Libyan army has been leading a military campaign since early April to take over the capital Tripoli from Serraj's government. According to the World Health Organization, the fighting has so far killed 454, injured 2,154 others, and displaced almost 60,000 civilians. Libya has been suffering escalating violence and political instability ever since the fall of the late leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime in 2011.
