Bahrain's Foreign Ministry on Saturday issued a travel advisory warning Bahraini people not to visit Iran and Iraq. The ministry called on all citizens in Iran and Iraq to leave immediately for their own safety and security. "This is due to the given unstable situation in the region and the recent escalations and threats against security and stability," it said. The ministry also opened hotlines to assist citizens amid the recent increased tensions from a potential US-Iran conflict. Bahrain cut all diplomatic ties with Iran in 2016, citing the latter's interference in its domestic affairs. The move came after demonstrators stormed and set fire to the Saudi Embassy in Iran.
