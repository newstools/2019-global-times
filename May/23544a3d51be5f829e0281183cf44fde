China's Qingdao city in Shandong Province signed a cooperation agreement on Sunday with a US medical service provider, aiming at improving healthcare in the coastal city. Hua Zhang, director of health commission of Qingdao, said the cooperation agreement, signed with US MORE Health company, will help Qingdao improve its medical service. "MORE Health will help us make connections with resources of Texas Medical Center (TMC), including people exchange and training. Just like other places in China, Qingdao city government is paying efforts to upgrade healthcare service." Based in Silicon Valley, California, telemedicine service provider MORE Health has entered the Chinese market and worked with Chinese healthcare providers to reach a growing number of patients and to provide shot-term training by introducing US medical experts to China. Fredrick Hagemeister, senior advisor of MORE Health, told Xinhua that he is looking forward to seeing the cooperation and collaboration, which helps bring specialized care to more people. Hagemeister is also an oncologist in Houston, US state of Texas, and is affiliated with University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. "We have access to certain technologies that we want to share with other people so that we can increase the number of patients who have care for cancer in the whole world," he said. "Developing newer therapies and newer relationships through whatever means possible is very valuable and important." Qingdao is a major seaport in eastern China.
