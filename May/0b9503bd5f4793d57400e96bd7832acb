Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza on Tuesday accused the US government of backing an attempted coup in Venezuela. "The heads of the coup d'etat acknowledge their backer without scruples," Arreaza tweeted. Arreaza made the remarks after US National Security Adviser John Bolton called on Venezuelan military leaders and other key officials to support opposition leader Juan Guaido. On Tuesday morning, Guaido showed up along with some military personnel outside La Carlota aviation military base in the east of the capital city of Caracas, according to Venezuelan media. Guaido called on civilians and soldiers to act against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. In response, Maduro said late Tuesday in a televised speech that his government had defeated the "small" coup attempt organized by those wanting to provoke a "massacre."
