The sector's revenue edged up 0.7 percent year-on-year to 446.3 billion yuan (about 64.7 billion US dollars) in the January-April period, data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) showed. The pace was down 0.3 percentage points from that registered in the first quarter. In breakdown, the revenue of fixed-line services saw an 11-percent year-on-year increase to 140.5 billion yuan while that for mobile services amounted to 305.7 billion yuan, down 3.4 percent from the previous year. The number of 4G phone users subscribed to China's three major telecom operators continued to rise during the period, exceeding 1.2 billion and accounting for over 75 percent of the total mobile phone users by the end of April.
