Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean futures closed higher on Thursday, as short-covering and US planting concerns are supportive to the oil seed. The most active soybean contract for July delivery added 4.25 cents, or 0.51 percent to close at 8.3975 dollars per bushel. July corn delivery was up 9.5 cents, or 2.57 percent to close at 3.79 dollars per bushel. July wheat delivery added 18.25 cent, or 4.07 percent to close at 4.67 dollars per bushel. CBOT soybean futures rose as dismal weather forecasts signaled further planting delays of corn and soybean in the US Midwest, prompting commodity funds to cover short positions. But concerns about US soybean exports to top buyer China due to trade frictions still kept strength in check. Investors are awaiting more information about US-China trade talks, following US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he would likely return to China for further negotiations. Corn futures rallied on the forecast for rain next week in the US Midwest, which raises questions about whether farmers will be able to reach their acreage targets for the year. CBOT wheat futures settled at a one-month high, led by the strength of corn and soybean.
