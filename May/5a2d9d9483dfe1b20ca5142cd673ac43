The first ever digital map of the thousands of kilometers of pipes and cables which run underneath London will be created to help reduce disruptions caused when they are struck by mistake, London mayor Sadiq Khan said Friday. The scheme will allow workers to see underground pipes and cables on mobile phones or laptop computers before they start a dig. It is estimated that the cost to the British economy of accidental strikes on underground pipes and cables is more than 1.5 billion US dollars a year, according to a City Hall statement. "Workers who hit gas and electric pipes by mistake can also put themselves in danger of death or serious injury," said the statement. The Mayor's Office is working closely with utilities, transport providers, and other partners to create the digital map. A similar project is also underway in Sunderland in northern England. "This innovative use of data has the potential to revolutionise day-to-day operations in the infrastructure sector. This pilot scheme is great news for London," said Jules Pipe, Deputy Mayor for Planning, Regeneration and Skills.
