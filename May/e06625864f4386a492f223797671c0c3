China on Friday called on all parties concerned to exercise restraint, strengthen dialogue and fully support and uphold the 2015 Iran nuclear deal."The deal is a multilateral agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council. It should be implemented fully and effectively as it is vital for the international non-proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told reporters at a daily press briefing."China regrets that unilateral sanctions and so-called 'long-arm jurisdiction' the US imposed on Iran have escalated tensions on the Iranian nuclear issue," Geng said, adding that "we call on all parties concerned to exercise restraint, strengthen dialogue, fully support and uphold the agreement."Â Geng's remarks came after European countries said on Thursday that they wanted to preserve Iran's nuclear deal.Iran relaxed restrictions on its nuclear program and threatened moves that might breach the 2015 international pact on Wednesday.Iran's announcement, related to curbs on its stockpiling of nuclear materials, was in response to US sanctions imposed following President Donald Trump's withdrawal of the US from the accord with Tehran a year ago.Trump on Thursday urged Iran's leadership to sit down and talk with him about giving up Tehran's nuclear program and said he could not rule out a military confrontation given the heightened tensions between the two countries.At an impromptu news conference at the White House, Trump declined to say what prompted him to deploy the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group to the region over what was described as unspecified threats."We have information that you don't want to know about," said Trump. "They were very threatening and we have to have great security for this country and many other places."
