Students from ethnic groups performed folk songs and dances to show harmony among the young Chinese.Meanwhile, young Chinese are engaged in a heated discussion on their understanding of the spirit of the May Fourth Movement. A forum on the movement was held in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Friday, with hundreds of youths discussing how to carry on the spirit of the movement and contribute to society's development. Feng Tian, a graduate student majoring in housing construction at Tongji University in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Saturday that she would like to devote herself to realizing the Chinese people's good life. "As an architecture student, I may not be able to fight for the country on the frontline or promote high technology, but I can still be helpful in small ways such as in redeveloping communities, making use of abandoned space and constructing urban areas," she said.Newspaper headline: Young Chinese celebrate May 4th centenary Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
