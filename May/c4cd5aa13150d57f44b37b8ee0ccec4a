Zhang Zhihe, director of Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, and Bengt Holst, scientific director of the Copenhagen Zoo attended the event and introduced pandas living habits and the recent updates of their lives in Copenhagen to the audience. The Danish Ambassador to China A. Carsten Damsgaard gave a speech. "A little more than a month ago, I had the pleasure of accompanying Mao Sun and Xing Er on the SAS flight to Copenhagen where they were warmly welcomed. Her Majesty the Queen inaugurated the magnificent new yin-yang-shaped panda house in Copenhagen, and in the month that has gone by since then, many Danish have come and said hello to them," the ambassador said. "Even though the pandas have only been in Denmark for a month, these two gentlemen have been working for nearly a decade."
