A container port in Rizhao, East China's Shandong Province, on May 15 Photo: ICChina's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Thursday harshly criticized "wrong" actions of the US against Chinese companies and vowed to take necessary measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of domestic companies.At a routine press briefing in Beijing, MOFCOM spokesperson Gao Feng also made it clear that China would not be open to trade negotiations unless the US shows sincerity and stops its wrong actions, and China will not back down on its core principles."Recently, the US has frequently used long-arm jurisdiction to suppress Chinese companies. China has consistently and resolutely opposed any country that arbitrarily sanctions Chinese companies and individuals based on its domestic laws," Gao said. "We urge the US to stop these wrong actions."Over the past few weeks, the US has constantly escalated the trade war with China, hiking tariffs on Chinese products and blacklisting Chinese telecom company Huawei. US officials are also reportedly considering blacklisting as many as five Chinese video-surveillance companies.Â In the latest move, the US on Wednesday imposed sanctions on 13 Chinese entities and individuals who US officials allege violated US sanctions against Iran, North Korea and Syria.Gao said that China has made solemn representation with the US over the measures and vowed that "China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies."China will continue to deepen reform and opening-up to create a stable, fair and predictable business environment for companies and help companies to improve their ability to cope with risks, according to the MOFCOM spokesperson."The best response to the US bullying is the continued growth of Chinese companies," Gao said. "The Chinese government has the confidence and capability to safeguard Chinese companies' legitimate rights and interests."Asked whether trade talks will continue with the US, Gao said that wrong actions by the US have seriously disrupted the trade talks and that Washington has to correct its actions and show sincerity before resuming talks."If the US wants to continue talks, it should display sincerity and correct its wrong actions," he said, adding that talks must be based on principles. "China will never give in on major issues of principle."Despite the recent escalation in the trade war, US officials have appeared to be calling for resuming talks with China. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said during a hearing in the US Congress on Wednesday (US Time) that he was still "hopeful" that the two sides will return to the table and suggested that there will be a meeting between the leaders of the two countries at the G20 summit in Japan in June.Gao did not answer questions as to whether there are any talks planned and referred questions about the G20 meeting to the Foreign Ministry.
