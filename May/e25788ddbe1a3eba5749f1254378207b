They uniformly worked longer hours for less pay than their white counterparts on the Union Pacific, and performed the most dangerous work. There were no power tools. Virtually all work was done by hand.Untold numbers - as many as 1,200 by some estimates - perished in blasting accidents, snowslides, falls and other mishaps."We Cantonese feel a pride that our roots are in these hardworking people who built this great iron road that connected America," Yu said."I feel that our biggest contribution would be for social justice, and to define what being an American is," she said.At the 1969 ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the railroad's completion, Yu's father was then vice president of the historical society and her mother the only descendant of the railroad workers who was present.They traveled to Utah with the then-president of the historical society, Phil Choy, who was supposed to address the ceremony. Actor John Wayne ended up speaking in his place, Yu said.Karen Kwan, a Democrat in the Utah House of Representatives who helped organize this year's Golden Spike event, said plans for highlighting the contributions of Chinese immigrants was "righting a wrong.""Our names were not recorded by and large. We were not given the recognition that we should have been given," said Kwan, the first Chinese-American elected to Utah's legislature. "Asian-Americans as a whole are often thought of as perpetual foreigners."Yu acknowledged feeling "a bit nervous" in light of a resurgence in xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments that echo a backlash against the Chinese following completion of theTranscontinental Railroad. That hostility led to passage of the federal Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, marking the first significant law restricting US immigration.Remaining on the books until 1943, the exclusion laws drove many immigrants to alter their names and falsify family ties, playing a role in making it hard for Chinese-Americans to trace their roots, according to San Francisco-based historian Sue Lee.Other factors include a general lack of records listing individual Chinese workers by name and the fact that many returned to their homeland after the project ended, Lee said.
