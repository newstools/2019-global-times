Five people have been confirmed dead and over 2,500 others were displaced due to the ongoing heavy rains in southwestern Tanzania's district of Kyela, in Mbeya region, an official said on Thursday. Salome Magambo, Kyela District Executive Officer, said the damage occurred in Matema and Bujonde wards, due to the downpour which started from April 29. "We have set up 14 camps in schools and churches located on elevated grounds where a total of 2,570 displaced persons are now sheltered," Magambo said. Magambo added that more people were taken in by their friends and relatives whose homes are in higher grounds. The government is catering for those living in the 14 camps with basic needs including food, medicine, and clean water to prevent the outbreak of waterborne disease, Magambo said. She thanked the business community in Kyela district for supporting the district's safety and security committees chaired by the District Commissioner in mobilizing humanitarian support for the victims.
