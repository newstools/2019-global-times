Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday signed a decree allowing certain foreign citizens and stateless persons to apply for Russian citizenship under a simplified procedure, the Kremlin said Wednesday. Several types of citizens of Ukraine, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Syria as well as stateless persons are granted the right to apply for admission to Russian citizenship under a simplified procedure, according to the decree published on the Kremlin's website. Ukrainian nationals who are permanently residing, or were born in Crimea and Sevastopol or have temporary Russian residence permits are those included in this list. Decisions on whether to grant Russian citizenship to the applicants will be made within three months. The decree enters into force from the day of its signing. Putin on April 24 signed a decree simplifying the process of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of Ukraine's insurgent Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which Kiev sees as interference in its internal affairs. In response, Ukraine's President-elect Volodymir Zelensky said Saturday that Ukraine will also be granting its citizenship to "suffering" Russians.
