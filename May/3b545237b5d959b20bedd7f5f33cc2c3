China's coastal bulk freight market saw an overall demand growth last month, according to the Shanghai Shipping Exchange (SSE). The composite index for coastal bulk freight rose to 1,037.4 in April, up 4.5 percent from a month earlier, the SSE said. The index had averaged 1,004.15 since the beginning of 2019, down from an average of 1,149.05 for 2018. Last month, the sub-index for coal saw the strongest rally of 5.6 percent to stand at 1,066.51, followed by grain and metal ore. The sub-index for crude oil remained flat in April. The SSE initiated the index in 2001 under the guidance of the Ministry of Transport to reflect the fluctuation of the Chinese coastal transport market.
