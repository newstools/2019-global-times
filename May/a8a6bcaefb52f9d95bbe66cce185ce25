Chinese parents are sending their children to training institutions to develop social skills and leadership skills from as early as three years old, as more EQ training institutions are opening up in big cities in China. BiggerEQ, a training institution based in Guangzhou in South China's Guangdong Province that's founded in 2017, told the Global Times that the institution's courses are designed to cultivate a set of skills around children's sociability.On the company's website, different courses are categorized into different types, with some claiming to improve the child's self-regulating ability while others promise to train the child into a quicker learner.  "The children will be enrolled in classes in resilience, problem solving, empathy, social communications and emotion control," a representative from the company said. BiggerEQ also told the Global Times that the students enrolled range from 3 to 12 years old. While smaller children are taught to be "confident and easy to communicate with parents", or "less sensitive and cry less", older children are taught in class to have better concentration in class."A lot of parents send their children to our institutions simply because they want them to have better habits that will help them later in life," the representative from BiggerEQ said.The institution said they courses are doing what the parents can't. "For example, some children are hyperactive, some have problems with emotion control, but the parents are not well trained to enough to know children psychology to deal with them properly. In our school, children can acquire social skills by attending our professionally designed games and lessons."The lessons for EQ do not come cheap though. On the website for TSOG-EQ, an EQ training institution based in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, a one year set of courses costs 16,800 yuan ($2,437), and its online training videos costs 3880 yuan.
