Other sectors are supposed to be invested in by the private sector."For government officials, the regulation will be a basic safeguard as they will henceforth have a concrete idea of the boundaries of their responsibility instead of relying on think tanks' advice or following their gut feelings," Ye Qing, a professor with Wuhan-based Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, told the Global Times.According to domestic financial news site yicai.com, government investment amounts to 3 trillion yuan ($443.37 billion).Feng Liguo, a research fellow with the research center at China Minsheng Bank, said the regulation will restrict local governments, which have huge say in how to invest fiscal budgets."Sometimes, local governments invest through SOEs they control solely to boost GDP, leading to redundancy and waste," Feng said. "Now, the Monkey King has its Golden Hoop on its head," Feng said, referring to a spell-casting object that kept the Monkey King under control in China's classic romance Journey to the West.In the first quarter, private-sector investment reached 6.15 trillion yuan, while the nation's total fixed-asset investment stood at 10.19 trillion yuan, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed in April. Feng said private investment accounted for about 60 percent of the national total, while government-led and SOE investment accounted for 20 percent. The rest was by foreign-invested firms in China.Practical stepsHowever, experts said much defining work, support policies and the drafting of industry-specific documents will be needed to flesh out the State Council regulation."It depends on the speed at which supporting regulations are rolled out. If more detailed regulations took, for instance, two years to see the light of day, the effect of the regulation will be compromised," Feng said. "Ideally, the country needs to roll out such policies within the year to keep the momentum." Detailed regulations and drafting of related documents must follow to really guide projects on the ground, Ye said."Due to the nature of public infrastructure, spending should be kept as low as possible to be responsible to taxpayers but should uphold some bottom line of quality," Ye said. "There is a balance to achieve and specific documents on standards for public products will need to be drawn up."Experts said that when government capital concedes certain sectors to the private sector, which boosts efficiency, overall social efficiency will be improved. Tian Yun, vice president of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, said the regulation should be upgraded into a law."Clarification in the investment sphere, a key driver of GDP growth, will help China's push in structural reform and achieving high-quality growth. It will also help stem systemic risks," Tian said. Tian said that much misallocation of resources exists in many localities, including Beijing Municipality.The new regulation will also strengthen oversight of budgets and ban raising investment funds through illegal borrowing, which is expected to ease the issue of rising local debt.Newspaper headline: New regulation will guide govt investment Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
