Trade disputes between China and the United States would have a negative effect on the investment climate if the "problem" cannot be solved soon, President of the European Commission (EC) Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday. "As far as trade relations between China and (the) United States are concerned, I have the feeling that a major part of the economic problems the world is facing have to be read in the context of these trade tensions between the United States and China," Juncker said in a press conference here. "If investors don't have the feeling that this problem can be solved soon, the appetite for investments on both sides of the Atlantic and throughout the world is weakening," he said. Invited by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who is also chief of the Chinese side of the China-US comprehensive economic dialogue, will visit the Untied States on Thursday and Friday to attend the 11th round of the bilateral consultation on trade issues. China on Tuesday expressed sincerity towards continuing economic and trade talks with the United States, saying the Chinese side does not evade conflict, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. "Negotiation itself is a process of discussion, and it is normal for the two sides to have differences," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang at a press briefing. Geng said China always believes that mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit are the premise and basis for reaching an agreement, and that adding tariffs will not solve any problems.
