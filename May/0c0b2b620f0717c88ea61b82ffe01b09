India's April retail inflation touched a six-month high by rising to 2.92 percent from 2.86 percent in the previous month, said a release by Ministry of Statistics & Program Implementation, Monday. However, the rise was still below the medium-term inflation target of 4 percent set by India's Central Bank. In April, provisional urban inflation rose to 4.23 percent from 4.1 percent in the preceding month while rural inflation rose to 1.87 percent from 1.8 percent respectively, the release said. Vegetable inflation grew to 2.87 percent in April from a negative 1.49 percent in the preceding month. On Friday, India's Index of Industrial production for March entered negative territory by contracting 0.1 percent. With inflation still below the Central Bank comfort level and economic growth contracting, experts believe that there would be further easing in key policy rates in the forthcoming June meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee.
