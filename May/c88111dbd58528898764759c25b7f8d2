Egyptian Minister of Transportation Kamel Al-Wazir stressed the importance of implementing a new electric train line around Cairo which is financed by a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (China EXIM Bank) with 1.2 billion US dollars. The minister called for immediate start of the civil works of the project while activating investment cooperation with the China EXIM Bank, during a meeting with heads of companies executing the electric train late on Thursday, according to Egypt's official MENA news agency. Al-Wazir stressed that the companies should start immediately to provide the work sites with equipment in order to start the work on the ground as of next week. The minister said that during his visit to China recently, he toured the factory that will manufacture the electric train, where he witnessed "the great potential of the factory." With the new 66-km network line, Egypt hopes that it can redevelop its exhausted railway system that has witnessed deadly accidents in the past few years.
