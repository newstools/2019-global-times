China on Tuesday expressed sincerity towards continuing economic and trade talks with the United States, saying the Chinese side does not evade conflict. "Negotiation itself is a process of discussion, and it is normal for the two sides to have differences," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang at a press briefing. Geng said China always believes that mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit are the premise and basis for reaching an agreement, and that adding tariffs will not solve any problems.
