Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan Hua Ning has said China will help strengthen South Sudan Broadcasting Cooperation (SSBC), a move that he noted will promote the revitalized peace process. Hua said China will enhance media exchanges and cooperation with South Sudan through an aided project that will see the country sponsor the setting up of a broadcasting center in Juba. The envoy added that the project will bring new opportunities for the development of South Sudan's media industry. "South Sudan Broadcasting Cooperation has played a unique role in advancing the country's peace process and also made positive contributions to enhancing the peoples' understanding of China," Hua said in Juba on Saturday after meeting with the managing director of SSBC, Magok Chilim Chok. He said the media has a robust potential to strengthen mutual cooperation between the two states. Chok thanked China for its continued support to strengthen the development of the country's media industry, saying that the Chinese aided project for the SSBC will help improve its television and radio broadcasting ability in all aspects. "The project will help the station provide higher quality news service to the public. The country is eager to learn more about China," Chok said.
