China is urging the US to respect the principle of the market economy and stop its groundless containment of Chinese firms in the name of national security, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday.The comment followed a decision by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday to deny China Mobile USA's bid to provide telecommunications services between the US and other countries, according to a document on the FCC's website.The FCC might revoke similar approvals for other state-owned carriers, including China Unicom and China Telecom, to operate in the US, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr.China has consistently encouraged its firms to invest overseas and comply with international rules, market laws and local regulations, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang told a regular briefing on Friday."We urge the US to respect the principle of the market economy, stop generalizing national security and its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies," said Geng.An environment characterized by fairness, justice and non-discrimination is needed for Chinese companies seeking to develop in the US, he noted.In 2011, China Mobile USA filed an application to provide international facilities-based and resale services between the US and other destinations. Last year, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a branch of the US Commerce Department, filed a recommendation to deny China Mobile USA's application due to national security and law enforcement concerns.
