More than 3,000 ink wash paintings are on display at the fair, which runs until Monday.  According to fair curator Wang Ji, the art fair aims to highlight the importance and artistic value of traditional Chinese ink wash painting. The expo features works from renowned Chinese artists including Xu Li, Su Xinping, Cai Guangbin, Li Ning and Zhu Lan.  Wang also noted that the fair hopes to catch the attention of Chinese collectors, who are willing to pay several million yuan on classic Western paintings or modern art, but rarely spend that amount on traditional Chinese ink wash works.
