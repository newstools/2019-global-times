Cambodia began on Saturday a five-day live-fire military exercise at a training ground here in southwestern Kampot province. Lieutenant General Hun Manet, deputy commander-in-chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAFs) and commander of the Royal Cambodian Army, said the annual drill was crucial to strengthen the capacity and expertise of troops in defending territorial integrity. "I'm strongly confident that after this drill, the participants will get new knowledge and experience, and will share them with other soldiers at their units," he said at the opening ceremony of the Golden Hanuman Exercise 2019. Lieutenant General Mao Sophan, deputy commander of the Royal Cambodian Army, said a total of 1,326 soldiers from various divisions, headquarters and units took part in the exercise. He said many types of heavy weapons including artilleries, BM-21 rocket launchers, RM-70 rocket launchers, tanks, armored vehicles, and helicopters were used in the exercise.
