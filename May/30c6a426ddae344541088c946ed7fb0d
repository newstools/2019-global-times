China would concentrate on its economic development.Dong Yue, a vice dean of the School of Law of the Ocean University of China, said that China's involvement in trans-regional and global issues in the region is in line with and based on its development of a community with shared future for mankind, the goal of which is to protect the men's common interests and promote sustainable development. As an important stakeholder in Arctic affairs, the natural conditions of the Arctic and their changes have a direct impact on China's climate and ecological environment, in turn, on its economic interests in sectors including the agriculture and marine industry, said Dong.And for such reasons, China's involvement in the rules to address issues such as global warming is inevitable, and its participation in regional governance based on bilateral and multilateral cooperation is legitimate and beneficial to all parties, Dong noted. China's State Council  in January 2018 published a white paper that argued that the future of the Arctic concerns the interests of the Arctic States, the well-being of non-Arctic States and that of humanity as a whole, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Newspaper headline: US selling China as threat to Arctic: experts Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
