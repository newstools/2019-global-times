A total of 200 tonnes of smuggled frozen food was recently seized by customs in south China's Guangdong Province, local authorities said. The public security bureau of Zhuhai, a city in Guangdong, said the smuggled frozen food worth around 4 million yuan (about 600,000 US dollars) was found in an inbound suspected vessel after the police received a tip-off on Monday. The frozen foods without any valid inspection or quarantine certification are semi-finished and unlabelled meat products from New Zealand, Australia and Brazil. Further investigation is underway.
