Venezuela's government delegation has returned from Norway "with good news" that its talks with the opposition had a good start, President Nicolas Maduro said on Friday. "The talks to advance agreements of peace, of amity, of harmony have got off on the right foot," Maduro said at a meeting with soldiers in the central Venezuelan state of Aragua. The representatives of each side had held talks in Norway this week "for the initiation and exploration of conversations and dialogue with the Venezuelan opposition to build an agenda of peace for the country," according to the president. Maduro said that he was committed to respecting the rules established in the exploratory meetings. "I believe in peace," he said. "Dialogue, yes; peace, yes; agreement, yes." Maduro also thanked the Norwegian government for "supporting the entire peace effort" and asked the Venezuelan people to support the dialogue process.
