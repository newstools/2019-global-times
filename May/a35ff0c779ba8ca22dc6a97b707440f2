Most of the people are not voting because they are afraid," said Lala Rosetta Ramaoka, 21, before she cast her ballot at the Mponegele Primary School in Seshego, eastern Limpopo province.Ramaphosa took over from corruption-accused Jacob Zuma who oversaw the ANC's most significant drop in support since 1994.He acknowledged on the eve of the election that "we are humble enough to admit our mistakes. We have taken decisive steps to fight corruption."The election comes 25 years after Nelson Mandela led the African National Congress to power in the country's first multi-racial vote which marked the end of apartheid.Support for the ANC has fallen in every election since 2004 with the party winning 54 percent in 2016 local elections, compared with 62 percent in 2014's national vote.Ramaphosa, 66, took office last year when Zuma was forced to resign as president by the ANC after nine years dominated by corruption allegations and economic problems.Most opinion surveys suggest the ANC will secure nearly 60 percent of the vote on Wednesday, thanks to Ramaphosa's appeal and a fractured opposition."It reflects the weakness of the opposition, more than it does reflect the achievements of the ANC," said political scientist Collette Schulz-Herzenberg from Stellenbosch University.The ANC has been confronted by deepening public anger over its failure to tackle poverty and inequality in post-apartheid South Africa."People are not happy with the ANC - but they are still voting for them," retired teacher Lockie Mans, 65, told AFP in Coligny in the North West province.The economy grew just 0.8 percent in 2018 and unemployment hovers around 27 percent - and over 50 percent among young people.Of the 47 opposition parties in the race, only the main opposition centrist Democratic Alliance (DA) and the radical-left Economic Freedom Fighters are major players.The DA hopes to shed its image as a white, middle-class party. Its first black leader Mmusi Maimane is contesting his first general election since taking the helm in 2015, and is expected to make modest gains on 2014's 22 percent vote share.
