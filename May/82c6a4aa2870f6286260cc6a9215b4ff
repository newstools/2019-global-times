Spain on Monday highlighted a "positive step" forward in forging closer ties with China on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) after a three-day forum. "The attendance of Minister Josep Borrell at the second Belt and Road Forum confirms the positive approach towards the initiative," the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the European Union and Cooperation said in a statement. Borrell attended the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRF) on April 25-27 in Beijing. He met with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi at a meeting on April 25, during which he said Spain appreciates China's contributions to upholding multilateralism and is willing to actively participate in the joint construction of the BRI. The meeting "highlights the new dimension that the bilateral relationship has acquired," the statement said. In an interview with Xinhua before leaving for the forum, Borrell reaffirmed Spain's "positive attitude" toward the BRI proposed by China in 2013. Expressing willingness to strengthen Spain-China cooperation, Borrell said "its full potential has not yet been achieved and we must continue working."
