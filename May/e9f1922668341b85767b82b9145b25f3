Britain's two main parties promised on Monday to work to resolve the deadlock over Brexit, hoping to win back voters who abandoned them for a new movement led by eurosceptic Nigel Farage at European elections.After a punishing night when Britain's deepening Brexit divisions were on show, the governing Conservatives said the results were a demand for the country to follow through on plans to exit the EU no matter what.Taking a different tack, the opposition Labour Party described a public vote - a new national election or second referendum - as a way to reunite the country.With Farage's Brexit Party capturing the greatest number of votes for seats in the European Parliament, Conservatives and Labour were under pressure to commit clearly to either side of the debate.Almost three years since Britain voted to leave the EU and just under two months after the originally planned departure date, lawmakers are still arguing over how, when or even whether the country will leave the club it joined in 1973.For the Conservatives, who will appoint a new leader by the end of July, many of the contenders will see the European vote outcome as proof that they must seek a cleaner break with the EU. For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, pressure will mount to embrace a second referendum without qualification.But what is clear for both from a vote which many used as a protest, Brexit, which has already forced Prime Minister Theresa May to say she will resign on June 7 over her failure to deliver Brexit, risks shattering their election prospects.
