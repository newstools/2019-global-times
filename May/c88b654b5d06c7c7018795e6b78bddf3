The Lao and Chinese media institutions have agreed to collaborate on the creation of more digital channels which will allow Lao and Chinese television audiences a broader range of programs. Director General of Lao National Television, Bounchao Phichit, and Chairman of the Yunnan Media Group, He Yaning, signed the agreement on Tuesday, witnessed by Lao Minister for Information, Culture, and Tourism, Bosengkham Vongdara, and the visiting Yunnan provincial governor Ruan Chengfa. Bounchao said the agreement will lead to more options on Lao Digital Television systems. LD Television, a Yunnan Media Group's branch company in Laos, provides digital television content to Lao audiences. The new channels will mean new programs will be available in both the Lao and Chinese languages. News and current affairs, light entertainment, a Chinese Movie Theater and travel documentaries are among the current suggestions. Local daily Vientiane Times on Thursday quoted Bounchao as saying that the new programs will promote mutual understanding of the politics and cultures of the Lao and Chinese peoples. The digitization of radio and television has enabled a greater number of people to access radio and television broadcasts than could previously when signals were solely analogue. The project signifies the further development of the Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting network in Laos. It is envisaged that the new channels will boost audiences and improve the ratings of programs available through LD Television.
