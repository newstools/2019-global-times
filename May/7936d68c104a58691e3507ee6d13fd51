South Africa's ANC surged into the lead in early official results Thursday with 55 percent of the vote in the first electoral test of President Cyril Ramaphosa's bid to revive the ruling party's flagging image.Ramaphosa, 66, took over last year after the African National Congress forced then-president Jacob Zuma to resign after corruption allegations and economic problems.With more than two-fifths of voting districts tallied, the Electoral Commission put the ANC well ahead, with its closest rival the Democratic Alliance trailing with a distant 25 percent.The Economic Freedom Fighters, founded six years ago by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, was nearing 9 percent.The final results are expected to be officially certified on Saturday.A new projection by the respected South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research forecast the ANC would win with 57 percent - a 5 percentage point drop from the last election in 2014.Â The party that wins the most seats in parliament selects the country's president, who will be sworn in on May 25.Ramaphosa has so far faced resistance to his reform agenda, especially from Zuma's allies who still occupy several high-ranking positions in the party and government.After casting his ballot on Wednesday, Ramaphosa said the election was "heralding a new dawn... a period of renewal, a period of hope.""The outcome of this election will be a major boost for... investor confidence."The ANC's reputation was badly sullied under Zuma. Its support has fallen in every election since 2004 with the party taking 54 percent in 2016 municipal elections, compared with 62 percent in 2014's national vote.
