The airport customs in Qingdao, eastern China's Shandong Province, said Wednesday that 80 pieces of ivory products were seized from a Chinese male passenger returning from Japan. Sixty-six pieces weighing 667 grams, including seals, combs, cigarette holders and beads, were intercepted during CT scanning at the airport. Another 14 pieces weighing 242 grams were found in a store run by the passenger. Besides the ivory products, six suspected red coral pendants weighing about 160 grams were found hidden in the luggage. A specimen of a precious animal weighing 56 grams was also seized in the store. China banned all domestic ivory trade at the end of 2017 as part of its commitment to protecting wild animals.
