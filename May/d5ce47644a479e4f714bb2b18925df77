China's top political advisor Wang Yang on Thursday met with visiting Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, and the two sides expressed willingness to enhance bilateral cooperation. Wang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, hailed the ever-deepening traditional friendship and fruitful outcomes in pragmatic cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries nearly six decades ago. No matter how the international situation changes, the friendly relations between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Cuba, as well as between the two countries, will not change, Wang said. The Chinese side stands ready to work with Cuba in jointly implementing the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, deepening political mutual trust, strengthening coordination on international and regional issues, and jointly building the Belt and Road, to score new achievements in developing traditional friendship and cooperation in various fields, Wang said. Speaking highly of the current China-Cuba relations, Rodriguez said the Cuban side is willing to deepen the two countries' pragmatic cooperation to advance bilateral ties to a higher level.
