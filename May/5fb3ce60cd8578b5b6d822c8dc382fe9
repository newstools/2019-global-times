Chinese TV personality Cui Yongyuan apologized Friday for publishing unverified materials online, after media reported that a judge who Cui spoke for was under investigation for fabricating stories against the Supreme People's Court and divulging state secrets.Former SPC assistant judge Wang Linqing has been under investigation by the procuratorate, and the police continued to investigate Zhao Faqi for allegedly illegally acquiring state secrets together with Wang, the Xinhua News Agency reported Friday.A joint investigation by major law-enforcement state departments released investigation results on February 2. Due to his discontent with the SPC, Wang stole the files of a mining rights case in Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, according to the investigation team, which also said Wang is suspected of illegally obtaining and deliberately divulging state secrets. The evidence against Wang has been turned over to public security organs for further investigation.On Friday afternoon, Cui published a handwritten apology on Weibo, saying that he firmly recognizes the conclusions made by the investigation team. "After much reflection on myself, I should not easily trust any material without careful verification. I deeply repent and sincerely apologize, and I'm willing to shoulder any responsibility," he wrote.On December 26, 2018, a post by Cui on his Weibo account said the files of a mining rights case in Shaanxi Province had been missing for two years and he asked the Supreme People's Court to explain.Using videos uploaded to Cui's Weibo, Wang said the judgment made by the Supreme People's Court on the North Shaanxi mineral rights case between Yulin Kechley Energy Investment Company and the Xi'an Geology and Mineral Exploration and Development Institute under the Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources is problematic because "files of the case are missing."However, the investigation concluded that the Supreme People's Court's judgment was consistent with the law.Global Times Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Actress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame starDelegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growth
