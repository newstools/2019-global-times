P.A.D.Y. by Zhao Bandi Photo: Courtesy of JianyaaChinese artist Zhao Bandi donated his latest work P.A.D.Y. to the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art on Saturday, the International Museum Day. The artist is known around the world for his works featuring pandas. For P.A.D.Y., he has moved his focus to donkeys - specifically, a donkey wearing a yellow tie. At the ceremony, the artist didn't explain the meaning of the title, but noted that the donkey in the photo is male. This is not the first time a donkey has appeared in Zhao Bandi's work. In 2018, he staged a ballet performance featuring a donkey in Switzerland and Beijing.
