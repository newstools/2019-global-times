File photo: ICMorgan Stanley reportedly lowered its ratings on some shares of China's four biggest banks on Tuesday, a move that surprised many industry insiders. It also upgraded the ratings of A shares of Ping An Bank and China Everbright Bank.According to a report from domestic news site 21jingji.com on Tuesday, citing a Morgan Stanley research paper, the bank downgraded the A-share ratings of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and China Construction Bank (CCB), and lowered the ratings of both A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China.However, analysts at some securities traders, such as Orient Securities (Hong Kong), disagreed with the downgrades, citing reasons such as steady profit growth and falling bad loans, the report said.All four banks saw steady net profit growth and falling bad loan rates in the first quarter of 2019, compared with a year earlier, according their financial reports.ICBC remained the most profitable bank among the "Big Four" banks, with net profit of about 82.69 billion yuan ($12.18 billion), a year-on-year increase of 4.58 percent. CCB reported profit of 76.9 billion yuan in the first quarter, a year-on-year increase of 4.2 percent.China's stock market has been volatile so far this week, rebounding on Tuesday after the Shanghai index experienced the biggest fall in about three years on Monday. At the close on Tuesday, the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.7 percent at 2,926.39, and the blue-chip CSI300 index was up 1 percent.Newspaper headline: Morgan Stanley downgrades ratings of countryâ€™s four largest banks: report Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
