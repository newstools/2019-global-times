Samsung didn't give any reason, but the cancellation, coming just days after reported defects in its sample screens, fueled market speculation about Samsung's flexible screen was ready for commercialization.Some industry insiders said it could be a chance for Chinese companies to show how their investments in AMOLED displays have translated into technology that is more cutting-edge and reliable than that of South Korean rivals. AMOLED is a display technology used in high-end smartphones that is more flexible than traditional liquid crystal display. Samsung now accounts for about 80 percent of the flexible panel's global capacity."Samsung's advanced AMOLED technology exists because it supplies OLED panels to its own smartphone brand, which enables it to improve technologies for mass production," Sun Yanbiao, head of Shenzhen-based research company N1mobile, told the Global Times on Monday.Chinese handset producers, including Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and ZTE, are rising rapidly in terms of global shipment, giving corresponding panel producers a wide consumer base to compete head-to-head with Samsung in AMOLED technological upgrades, Sun said.In the first quarter of 2019, Huawei overtook Apple in smartphone shipments to become the world's No.2 smartphone vendor, capturing a 19-percent global market share, according to a report released by IDC on Tuesday.  In China, BOE Technology Group was chosen over Samsung as the flexible panel supplier of Huawei's foldable smartphones. BOE recently signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Huawei to serve as a core panel supplier for high-end flagship smartphones, Huawei confirmed to the Global Times on Monday. South Korea-based Etnews also reported that BOE will break Samsung's domination of iPhone OLED screens and become a panel supplier for iPhones in 2020, a move analysts said will expand BOE's client base and bolster its competitiveness. BOE joined Apple's liquid crystal display panels supplier list in 2017.BOE, the Beijing-based manufacturer has started mass production at its 6th generation AMOLED facility in Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan Province, with another production line in Sichuan's Mianyang expected to begin mass production by the end of 2019, a member of BOE's PR department told the Global Times.Another panel maker Royole started producing flexible OLEDs at its Quasi-6-Gen fab in Shenzhen in June 2018, a company spokesperson told the Global Times. About 10 AMOLED production lines will be built in China in the next three years, asia.nikkei.com reported. "Working with Chinese vendors will help panel producers learn industry trends. Some vendors also have the capital and resources to help manufacturers innovate and boost their comprehensive yield rate," Sun said.Newspaper headline: Chinese firms break S.Korea’s panel monopoly Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
