And there is a high possibility that they would commit the same offense again, according to thepaper. Prior to Shanghai's restrictions, Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province, implemented a similar system for checking criminal records of people convicted of sexual assault of minors,  the Guangzhou Daily reported in March.More than 300 cases of child sexual assaults involving 750 minors were reported last year in China, according to a 2019 report released by the Girls' Protection Fund of the China Foundation of Culture and Arts for Children and Beijing All in One Foundation.
