International visitor arrivals to New Zealand in March were down 10,100 compared with the same month last year, partly because of the mosque attacks in Christchurch, Stats NZ said on Tuesday. The total number of visitor arrivals was 378,300 in March 2019. Visitor arrivals were down for most countries compared with the same month last year. The largest drops were in arrivals from: Australia (down 12,600); Britain (down 4,400); China's Hong Kong (down 2,800) and China (down 2,400). "Although visitor arrivals in March 2019 were down compared with March 2018, they actually tracked higher for the first three weeks of March," Brooke Theyers, the population insights senior manager, said. "However, visitor numbers are much lower compared with the latter half of March 2018," Theyers added. March visitor numbers are likely affected by the timing of the Easter holiday -- late March in 2018 and mid-April in 2017 and 2019. The March 15, 2019 mosque attacks in Christchurch may have had some impact on visitor numbers. A clearer picture should emerge over the coming months, Theyers said. Total visitor arrivals for the year ended March 2019 were 3.87 million, up 47,900,or 1.3 percent, from the year ended March 2018.
