Thousands of people in Iran's capital Tehran on Friday rallied in support of recent Iranian government's decision to suspend the implementation of some of its commitments under the nuclear deal in response to the US withdrawal from the deal last year. According to local media, similar rallies were held in other Iranian cities after the Friday prayers. In Tehran, people chanted slogans and held placards in support of the Iranian government's decision. The rallies also issued a statement warning the United States against "any further provocation against Iran." The statement also called for a full suspension of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the nuclear deal, if European signatories fail to uphold Iran's interests under the deal. On Wednesday, Iran withdrew from implementing part of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal and threatened to take more actions in case Tehran's interests under the pact cannot be guaranteed. The move by Iran comes after US President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal in May last year and resumed energy and financial sanctions on the Islamic republic.
