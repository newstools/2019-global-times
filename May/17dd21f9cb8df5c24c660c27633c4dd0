Stanford University says Zhao Yusi, who was reportedly involved in the school’s admission scandal, was expelled for fabricating application materials, and her admission had nothing to do with a $500,000 donation.The university said it did not know the previously reported $6.5 million donation, which the student reportedly paid to enroll in, the Beijing Youth Daily reported.The response came after Zhao reportedly paid $6.5 million through education consultant William "Rick" Singer to get into Stanford. She was recruited into the school's sailing program despite not being a sailor, media reported.In response to the Beijing Youth Daily, Stanford said that the school’s sailing program received $770,000 from Zhao’s education consultant Singer and did not know whether the money was part of the $6.5 million, according to the report.The $770,000 was split between three students; two others gave $110,000 and $160,000 to the former coach of the school’s sailing team, but they did not get in.The school’s sailing program received a $500,000 donation from Zhao’s family a few months after she was admitted, the Beijing Youth Daily reported on Tuesday.But Zhao has nothing to do with the sailing team and she did not have a letter of recommendation from sports talents when she was enrolled, the newspaper quoted Stanford as saying.Zhao was expelled from the university in April this year because of fabricating her application, said Stanford, but it failed to go into details.It also said it is dealing with the $770,000 donation, and the best option may be to donate the money to an entity which has nothing to do with Stanford. The school said the money came from a scandal and they want to do the right thing.The university said they have found that no-one was enrolled by using the recommendation letter for the sailing program but the case is alarming, so they will re-evaluate certain examination measures to make sure it doesn’t happen again.Stanford said donations will not affect its admissions process and it is trying to clear up any misunderstanding by donors that money is used to buy a degree.It also said the university rejected many applicants who come from families with Stanford alumni and donors.Zhao Yusi's father, Zhao Tao, is reportedly the chairman of Shandong Buchang Pharmaceuticals, a supplier of traditional Chinese medicine to fight cardiovascular disease. Zhao Tao, 53, born in Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, is a citizen of Singapore reportedly worth $1.8 billion, according to Forbes.Media reported that Singer was the owner of college counseling and prep business The Key and CEO of the Key Worldwide Foundation. He allegedly facilitated cheating in tests and bribing college coaches and administrators during admissions.
