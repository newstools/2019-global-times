Afghanistan's Taliban group on Wednesday announced the start of a new round of peace talks with the United States in the Qatari capital of Doha. The announcement was made by the Taliban's spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on his Twitter account. The US-Taliban negotiations are aimed at securing a lasting peace agreement which would include the Taliban's guarantees regarding terrorism and a phased withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. Zalmay Khalilzad, chief of the US delegation, has said the talks will ultimately focus on four main issues: withdrawal, guarantees against terrorism, a lasting cease-fire and talks between the Taliban and the US-backed government of Afghanistan to establish a path toward a political settlement.
