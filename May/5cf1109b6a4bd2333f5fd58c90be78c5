Top political advisor Wang Yang Friday met with representatives of media outlets from both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The trend of the times that the cross-Strait relations move forward in the new era cannot be obstructed by anyone or any forces, said Wang, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, while meeting with the representatives who attended a media summit in Beijing. Media outlets across the Strait shoulder the social responsibility of maintaining and promoting the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, said Wang, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. He called on the media on both sides to continue giving voice to pushing forward the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and advancing the process toward the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to make their contributions to realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
