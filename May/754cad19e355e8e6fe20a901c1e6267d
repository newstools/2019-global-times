A Vietnamese foreign ministry spokesperson expressed delight that Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese woman accused of causing death of a Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) man, has been released and reunited with her family in Vietnam, Vietnam News Agency reported on Saturday. "We are glad that Vietnamese citizen Doan Thi Huong has been released and reunited with her family in Vietnam. This outcome was contributed by the continuous efforts of the government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, relevant agencies and the Bar Federation of Vietnam as well as the Malaysian lawyers to protect Doan Thi Huong," said spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang. "We also acknowledge the positive actions toward this end taken by the Malaysian relevant authorities in the recent time," the spokeswoman added. After being set free on Friday, Huong took a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam on the same day. On April 1, a Malaysian court sentenced Huong to three years and four months imprisonment in connection with the death of the DPRK man at Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017 after she pleaded guilty to the charge of causing injuries using dangerous means, instead of the initial charge of murder. The prison term was calculated starting from the time Huong was detained in February 2017. Her lawyer said Huong was granted a remission of one third of her jail term for good behavior.
