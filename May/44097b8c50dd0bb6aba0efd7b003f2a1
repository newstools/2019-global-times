Photo: ICAntifa and far-right groups' May Day brawl in Portland is a symbol of aggravating ideological division in US society caused by "deviated domestic policies" but will not expand nationwide due to the spirit of compromise rooted in US politics, a Chinese expert said Sunday. Anti-fascist group Antifa and far-right groups Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys clashed in Portland on Wednesday evening soon after police praised peaceful May Day protests across the city, Newsweek ­reported Thursday.People from both sides fought and sprayed bear repellent and pepper spray at each other, Fox News reported Thursday.Police estimated about 60 people were involved in the disturbance outside a bar in northeast Portland.The clashes broke out after a day of generally peaceful May Day protests across Portland where hundreds rallied for the rights of immigrants, workers and other marginalized groups at venues including Elizabeth Caruthers Park and Chapman Square, Fox News said.Antifa is a conglomeration of left-wing autonomous, militant anti-fascist groups in the US that sometimes use violent measures in combat against neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Antifa grabbed headlines by throwing Molotov cocktails, destroying property and wearing black masks in Berkeley in 2017 when Trump supporter Milo Yiannopoulos was to hold a speaking event at the University of California.The small clash between people from the two extreme groups showed the fragmentation of US society was escalating due to "the deviated domestic policies of conservatism and America First," Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of American Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday."However, no similar brawls will extend nationwide because of the spirit of compromise rooted in US politics," Liu said. "All parties will reach a common ground with shared values as long as the US core interests, such as economic ­interest and US hegemony, are not threatened by any group."
