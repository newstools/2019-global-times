A senior Communist Party of China (CPC) official has called for efforts to better inform the people of China's achievements over the past 70 years and its future development plans. Huang Kunming, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks during an inspection and research tour to Guangdong from May 17 to 19. Noting that mass activities are being held across China's urban and rural areas to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, he underscored extensive publicity efforts to explain to the people China's situation and policies. The people should be clearly informed of the achievements China has made under the leadership of the CPC, the enormous potential and bright prospects for China's economic development, the plans made by the CPC Central Committee to promote high-quality development and improve people's wellbeing, according to the official. Initiatives designed to promote social etiquette and civility should be community-based and focus on serving communities, and Party organizations of various levels should better play their roles of mobilizing resources to step up ideological work to build consensus among the people and relieve their worries, he said.
