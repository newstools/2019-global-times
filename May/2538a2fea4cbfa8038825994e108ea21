For example, more than 50 percent of all civilian jets operated in China are Boeing aircraft, according to public information. Apart from the trade war backdrop, China's intensified efforts to achieve "the legalization of the market is an inevitable direction," Huang Yong, a professor at University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times Tuesday.The establishment of a sound anti-monopoly legal system in China is also for the purpose of integrating with international markets and ultimately reducing international conflicts, Huang said.Newspaper headline: Nation to bolster efforts against monopoly practices Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
