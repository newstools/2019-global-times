LinkedIn said Tuesday that it is making progress in localization in China, taking it from a platform connecting global professionals to a one-stop shop for career development with deeper understanding of professionals.According to a note sent to the Global Times, the company said it has launched new products including a career guide, salary insights, career Q&A sessions and e-learning facilities, targeting all levels of professionals, whether they be new entrants or highly experienced members of the workforce. For example, Chinese subscribers can communicate with global recruiters to get first-hand information through LinkedIn's latest product function "conversational hiring". Also, with the help of the "salary insights" tool, the subscribers can obtain salary distribution data and real-time salary reference points for popular jobs to assess their value, assisting professionals to take more objective and informed career decisions. The company said it has data on 630 million LinkedIn members, 50,000 skills, 30 million companies, more than 20 million open jobs and 90,000 schools, from which more than 1 billion data points and 50 billion connections have been established.
