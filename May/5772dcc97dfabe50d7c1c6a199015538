The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired an unidentified projectile eastward from its northwestern region Thursday afternoon, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The projectile was launched from an area in North Pyongan province, north of Pyongyang, at about 4:30 p.m. local time (0730 GMT), the JCS said in a brief statement. The JCS said it was precisely analyzing the projectile whose type was still unknown. It came just five days after the DPRK fired several short-range projectiles into the sea off its east coast Saturday. The South Korean military believed that the short-range projectiles were fired from 240-mm and 300-mm multiple rocket launchers and a new type of tactical guided weapons. Chung Eui-yong, top national security advisor for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, was closely monitoring the situations at the national crisis management center via video conference with the defense ministry and the JCS, the presidential Blue House said.
