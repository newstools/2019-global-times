The change has reportedly affected hundreds of jobs and big companies such as Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc.The US has had this approval system in place for a long time, but the change in approval times can't be understood without looking at the big picture of the China-US trade war, China's rising challenge to US technology dominance and a rising voice in Washington calling for the US to decouple from China.For years, the US has been relying on China's pipeline of talent to fuel its cutting-edge industries, which require a handsome input of human capital. One interesting fact is that Chinese nationals account for a large share of non-US citizens holding such jobs. On the other end of the pipeline, China's vast population, its rigorous educational system and diligent students have yielded a large pool of talent in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Many of these people pursue further studies in the US and then work there. Now the door is closing for those with Chinese nationality, and this has revealed the tendency of the US to discriminate against experts for no reason except nationality. This stance could have collateral damage as experts from other countries may feel they are the next to be expelled.However, the days when the world's top people would rely on the US to realize their potential and achieve their ambitions, due to its great platform, state-of-the-art hardware and great incentives, are also fading. Such people can now work elsewhere, and China appears to be a top alternative with its burgeoning digital economy, growing emphasis on basic research and rising respect for intellectuals.As the flow of talent reverses in the China-US pipeline, the balance of technological competitiveness may tip over, too, in favor of China.One of the founding blocks of American technological supremacy is the country's ability to absorb and retain experts, no matter where they are from. The foundation is cracking with the discrimination we are seeing.Newspaper headline: Block on talent undermines US Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
