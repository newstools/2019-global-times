Africa is heading steadily toward achieving sustainable development through the implementation of its ambitious Agenda 2063, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said on Saturday in a televised speech marking Africa Day. Sisi, whose country currently chairs the African Union (AU), said that the private sector and governments in Africa should work together to develop the continent's infrastructure and improve its human resources. Africa Day marks the establishment of the AU, then called the Organization of African Union, on May 25, 1963 after several African states gained independence from Western colonization. The 56th Africa Day comes while many African countries and regions are suffering conflicts, insurgencies or deteriorating security conditions, including Libya, Sudan, South Sudan and so on. "Day after day, the effectiveness of our joint efforts increases in finding solutions to the conflicts and the problems that the continent has been suffering for decades," said the Egyptian president. He added that Africa is open to cooperation with international partners, including governments, organizations, corporations and financial institutions, to build the future of Africa based on fair and win-win partnership.
