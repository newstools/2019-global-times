The forum will take place from May 31 to June 2 at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore.An Gang, a senior research fellow at the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing-based think tank, told the Global Times on Tuesday that "the backdrop of this year's forum is the worsening China-US relationship, and the US is clearly executing a strategy to comprehensively compete with China."Washington will definitely ramp up its accusations and attacks against China at different international forums, An noted. "The more accusations the US makes, the more necessary for China to respond and engage, and the more chances for China to promote its own views to win support. This is why China decided to send its defense minister with a huge People's Liberation Army (PLA) delegation," An said. US Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan will also speak on June 1, a day ahead of Wei's speech, the IISS statement said. The Shangri-La Dialogue favors the US, but China is still willing to send a senior official to attend, so this shows that China is sincere in maintaining communication with the US despite a tense bilateral relationship, Xu Guangyu, a senior consultant at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times on Tuesday.A military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday that "sending the defense minister to the forum is not necessarily connected with the current China-US relationship," since this is not the first time that China has sent senior military leaders to the forum. Considering the current China-US relationship, it would not be surprising at all if the meeting between Chinese and US military delegations don't take place in Singapore, and if they meet, we should not have very high expectations, the expert said.Neither the Chinese Defense Ministry nor Pentagon has confirmed whether a meeting between Wei and Shanahan would take place."Topics like the South China Sea, Taiwan and the PLA presence in the Indian Ocean could be covered," Xu said.But China doesn't need to be worried, because attendees of other countries won't follow the US too closely this time, and many will stay neutral, according to Xu. "Look at the case of Huawei. Many US allies such as the UK and France are not following the instructions of Washington DC anymore," he said. The IISS Shangri-La Dialogue is an annual Asia defense forum, where ministers, military chiefs and leaders from the region and beyond engage in open debate and bilateral talks aimed at enhancing their collaboration in response to the diverse security problems. The first forum was held in 2007, and China sent its defense minister to the forum in 2011 for the first time.Newspaper headline: Defense chief to speak at intl forum Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
