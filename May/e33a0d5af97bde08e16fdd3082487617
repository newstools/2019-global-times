Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro led a "march for military loyalty" here on Thursday, calling on the National Bolivarian Armed Forces (FANB) to remain united. "We are making new history and the FANB must appear before the people united and cohesive, increasingly united, increasingly cohesive, increasingly disciplined, more subordinate to the constitutional leadership," said Maduro. Speaking at Venezuela's national military academy in a televised national address, Maduro hailed the value of loyalty "in our fight against imperialism, against traitors and coup mongers." The event aimed to recognize the role of the military in thwarting Tuesday's attempted "coup" by the opposition leaders. On Tuesday, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who had proclaimed himself as Venezuela's interim president, reportedly called on the Venezuelan people and military to take to the streets to overthrow Maduro.
