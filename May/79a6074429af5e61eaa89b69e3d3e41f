Some foreign scientists questioned the safety of Chinese herbal medicines and the absence of double-blind evidence-based reports on its efficacy.Animal rights advocates also warned that the decision would endanger animals such as tiger, pangolin, bear and rhino, whose organs were used in some TCM cures. Even within China, critics worry that TCM can cause adverse drug reactions, of which the best-known issue was Houttuynia injections that killed at least 44 people. On June 1, 2006, China's State Food and Drug Administration temporarily suspended the use and approval of seven TCM injections including Houttuynia injections."Problems do exist in development of the TCM industry," Zhou Lihua, an expert with the AIDS research center at the Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, told the Global Times on Sunday."However, TCM is based on more than 2,500 years of Chinese medical practice and has proven to be effective."Newspaper headline: TCM ready for expanding international market Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Utah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental RailroadActress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame star
