During a demonstration on Thursday, an artificial intelligence (AI) server the size of a laptop used 200 cameras to complete a real-time intelligent video analysis task - matching the faces of several hundred audience members with their previously provided photos, achieving a 100 percent match rate within one second.The AI server, developed by Shanghai-based YITU Technology, has computing power equivalent to eight NVIDIA P4 servers, but it's half the size and uses just 20 percent of the P4's energy.Â The chip called QuestCore offers a visual analysis performance two to five times faster than the similar products available on the market with the same power consumption."Generally speaking, QuestCore is the most intelligent and cost-effective video analysis chip in the world," said Lu Hao, YITU's chief innovation officer, adding that it was 100 percent designed and manufactured in China.He said the SoC (System-on-Chip), the equivalent of a computer motherboard on a single chip, will improve China's semiconductor industry and bring down the cost of AI application and promotion for Chinese companies in fields such as security, healthcare, retail and smart cities.YITU took the top spot in facial recognition tests held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the US Department of Commerce for three consecutive years.According to China's plan for AI development, the AI industry will serve as a major economic growth engine by 2020.Newspaper headline: Shanghai AI start-up launches groundbreaking chip that saves money and energy Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Actress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame starDelegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growth
