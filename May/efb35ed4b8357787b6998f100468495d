Iran warned Wednesday that the 2015 nuclear deal between the Islamic republic and world powers is at the risk of collapse due to the US behavior, Tasnim news agency reported. Iran gave enough chances to diplomacy on the deal but "enough is enough. Iran's patience is running out," Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in the Turkish capital of Ankara on Wednesday. The US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, is a violation of UN Security Council resolution, Araqchi was quoted as saying. "Even worse, the US is calling on other countries including other members of the Security Council to do the same and violate the Security Council resolution," he added. Due to the US behavior, "diplomacy and negotiation are losing ground and the concept of resistance is gaining ground due to the US policy on the region," he said.
