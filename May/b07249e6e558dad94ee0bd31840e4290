The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee recently released  "comprehensive and detailed" regulations over the education and management of all Party members, including digital administration, management of Party membership, and management and education of mobile Party members.The regulations state that the Party membership of those who have lived abroad for more than five years without returning will be suspended, as well as for those who have lost touch with Party organs for more than six months and could not be reached. However, those whose Party memberships were suspended could be reinstated in accordance with the prescribed procedures.The regulations also put forward rules on the management of mobile Party members. The grassroots Party organs should keep regular contact with members who have been away for more than six months and have not transferred their organizational ties from the local Party branch. The Party organizations should do follow-up services on education, train and serve mobile Party members. A mobile Party member refers to those who joined the Party in a branch but moved to another place beyond the jurisdiction of the original branch, said Su Wei, a professor at the Party School of the CPC Chongqing Municipal Committee."For various reasons, many Party members moved out and lost touch with their own Party branches for more than six months in recent years. The grassroots Party organs would remove such members from the Party or leave them unresolved," said a Party secretary of the local municipal committee of Chinese people's political consultative conference organ in East China's Anhui Province, who requested anonymity. According to him, the regulations provide detailed and practical management for the membership of these Party members, which are easy to understand and convenient to follow.In the past, a Party member who failed to take part in the regular activities of his or her own Party organization, pay membership dues, or carry out work assigned by the Party for six consecutive months, without a legitimate reason, shall be regarded as having given up his or her own membership, said the revised Party Constitution. The regulation also stressed the need to use the internet and digitalization to educate Party members. The regulation notes that Party members should take advantage of online resources to learn and train themselves, publicize Party policies and hear the public's opinions.Party members are also encouraged to fight wrong online opinions, and are forbidden from making, publishing or disseminating information that violates Party regulations and the country's laws.
