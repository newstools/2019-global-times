Ten major airports in China showed negative growth in throughput in April, mainly due to seasonal factors, temporary events and extreme weather, said officials.These airports achieve throughput of over 10 million passengers annually. Among them, Beijing Capital International Airport experienced the biggest drop in throughput of 5.9 percent year-on-year in April, followed by Haikou Meilan International Airport, down 2.1 percent year-on-year."The nation's airports transported 110 million passengers in April, up 3.7 percent year-on-year, whereas 10 major airports saw drops in throughput," said Zhang Qing, official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), when explaining the negative growth at a press briefing Wednesday.There were a number of explanations for the drops. First, there was demand deferral for some flights due to seasonal factors, such as the May Day holidays, which began on May 1 this year, rather than late April, Zhang noted."Temporary events also have had a great impact on flight arrangements. For instance, the construction and temporary restrictions on the runways at Beijing Capital International Airport resulted in an 8.3 percent year-on-year decrease in the number of aircraft taking off," Zhang said.Additionally, flight operations in April were affected by an increase in extreme weather, mainly the early arrival of thunderstorms, which caused nearly 3,000 flights to be canceled in central and eastern China, and poor weather accounted for 45.75 percent of the overall delays, up 7.81 percent year-on-year, said Sun Shaohua, an official of CAAC.However, Zhang also said that the monthly increase in airport throughputs in April was one percentage point higher than that in March.From the perspective of supply, the growth rate of available seat kilometers in the whole industry in April was 8.35 percent, 1.7 percentage points higher than the growth rate of passenger turnover, Zhang said.Regarding price performance, the price index of national civil aviation passenger transport was 92.6, down 6.39 percent year-on-year, she said.Zhang pointed out that civil aviation was experiencing normal economic cycle fluctuations with industry supply sufficient for market demand.Lin Zhijie, an aviation expert, said the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX may also be one of the reasons for the negative throughput growth of some airports, according to The Beijing News on May 9.In order to ensure the safety of civil aviation in China, CAAC made a decision in March to suspend the commercial operation of the Boeing 737-8 aircraft in state transportation airlines in the wake of two fatal air disasters, both of which involved newly delivered Boeing 737-8 jets and occurred in the takeoff stage with certain similarities.China has had the world's second largest air transport system since 2005, with 234 transport airports, including 37 with an annual passenger throughput of more than 10 million and 10 with an annual passenger throughput of more than 30 million as of the end of November last year, CAAC said.The CAAC has delivered tax and fee cuts to all major airlines to increase throughput, and a recent guideline stated burdens on airlines will be reduced in the next one to two years.
