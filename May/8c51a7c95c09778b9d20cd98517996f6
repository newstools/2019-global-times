China's top procuratorate has established a new rule urging Chinese procuratorial organs to better deal with petition letters and visits. The regulation requires that procuratorial organs at all levels give procedural responses to petitions within seven days and report the handling process or investigation results to petitioners within three months. To ensure the implementation of the regulation, multiple measures have been taken by procuratorial organs across the country. In China's central Henan Province, special centers were set up by provincial procuratorate to deal with online petitions and supervise the responding process after the procedural response. In Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, a local procuratorate service hotline was used to conduct surveys among petitioners to enhance the effectiveness of the work and oversee the handling procedure. A total of 84,567 letters had been received by China's procuratorial organs since March 2019, and the rate of procedural responses given within seven days reached 94.1 percent by the end of April.
