Former vice minister of finance Zhang Shaochun was sentenced to 15 years in prison Monday for taking bribes worth 66.98 million yuan (about 9.8 million US dollars). His illegal gains will be turned in to the national treasury. He was also fined 6 million yuan, according to a statement by the Beijing Second Intermediate People's Court. The court found that between 1995 and 2018, Zhang took advantage of his positions to benefit others in business, personnel promotion and school enrollment. In return, he accepted gifts and money worth 66.98 million yuan. The statement said the court handed down the sentence while taking into consideration the fact that Zhang confessed, showed repentance and was cooperative in returning his illegal gains.
