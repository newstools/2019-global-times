China's stance on the trade frictions initiated by Washington gained understanding and support from the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) members, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Wednesday. Wang, who is also Chinese State Councilor, said he has briefed his counterparts on the situation about the trade frictions at the SCO ministerial meeting in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek. The setback in the trade negotiations was caused by the US consistent refusal to resolve China's reasonable concerns and its use of extreme pressure, Wang told his counterparts. China's response is aimed not only at safeguarding its own rightful interests, but also safeguarding the norms of international relations and protecting the free trade system, Wang stressed. Noting that no unfair deals can be reached or recognized, Wang said that if the United States is ready for talks in an equal way, China's door is wide open; but if Washington chooses to exert extreme pressure, China will fight to the very end. The SCO members will jointly oppose any form of unilateralism and trade protectionism, according to a joint communique issued by the ministers following their talks.
