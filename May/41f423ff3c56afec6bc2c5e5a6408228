The White House said Friday night that it has known the latest action of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and will monitor the situation. In a statement, the White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders said that "we are aware of North Korea's actions tonight. We will continue to monitor as necessary." South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said earlier on the same day that the DPRK has fired unidentified short-range projectiles off its east coast. US National Security Advisor John Bolton has reportedly briefed President Donald Trump on the situation, according to US media. There is no comment so far from the DPRK on the issue.
