Broken porcelain awaits expert restoration. True restoration not only preserves the historic significance of a relic, but also reflects its aesthetic value, according to Restoration 1860 experts.

So it's hard to say at the moment how many cultural relics will be restored by the end."Six damaged porcelain items have been selected to pioneer the repair process including two bowls that date back to the reign of Emperor Kangxi (1661-1722), read a press release the park's administration office sent to Global Times on Sunday.The six relics will one day be exhibited at the park and undergo three-dimensional laser scanning to be included in an online digital museum. Restoration 1860 is designed to accelerate the pace of restoring cultural relics, rekindling the park's past splendor and better protecting those relics, Chen said. The park began to work on cultural relics in the 1990s. The Restoration 1860 project is not open to individual visitors but can receive group bookings in advance.
