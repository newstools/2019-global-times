Sri Lanka will host the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Colombo in May 2021 which will attract over 3,000 delegates, the Finance Ministry said here Wednesday. Local media reports, quoting Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, said the annual meeting of the ADB Board of Governors was an opportunity for member governments to interact with ADB staff, non-government organizations (NGOs), and representatives of observer countries, international organizations, and the private sector. Over 3,000 delegates from 67 members will attend this meeting, while preliminary discussions have already been held with Colombo hoteliers regarding the arrangements of logistical facilities for the conference. Samaraweera said over 3,000 hotel rooms are estimated to be needed for the delegates. The decision to hold the 2021 annual meeting of the ADB was taken at its 52nd annual meeting held in Fiji early this month. The next meeting of the ADB is scheduled to be held in South Korea in 2020.
