Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Wednesday voiced his country's rejection to a US plan to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. "The US is in no position to ... start naming others as terror organizations and we reject by any attempt by the US in this regard," Zarif told reporters on the sidelines of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue, inaugurated earlier in the day in the Qatari capital Doha. "The US is supporting the biggest terrorist in the region, that is Israel," he said. The White House said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump is working to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, which would lead to sanctions against the oldest Islamist movement of Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood is a transnational Islamist organization founded in Egypt by Islamic scholar and schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna in 1928.
