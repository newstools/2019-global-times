Disney and Marvel's "Avengers: Endgame" has raked in 3 billion yuan (around 445 million US dollars) in box office sales in China's mainland since it hit the screens on April 24. As the 4-day May Day holiday started on Wednesday, the film is expected to continue its momentum in the following days, which might set it in place to surpass "Wandering Earth" as the best-selling film in the Chinese mainland market in 2019. It has replaced "The Fate of the Furious" by the end of Tuesday to become the top-grossing imported film of all time in the mainland.
