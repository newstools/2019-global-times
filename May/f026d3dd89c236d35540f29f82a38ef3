As a fundamental and strategic resource, data has become a key driving force for high-quality development of the Chinese economy, an official has said. The big data industry has prompted transformation of development patterns, optimization of economic structure, and a shift towards new growth engines, Minister of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) Miao Wei said Sunday at the opening ceremony of the China International Big Data Industry Expo 2019. China will step up efforts in enhancing innovative abilities, while promoting integration of the industry with the real economy, Miao said. According to Miao, the country will also strengthen its data governance and continue to optimize the environment of the sector. The big data industry is set to embrace further opening-up and win-win cooperation, Miao added. The China International Big Data Industry Expo 2019, held from May 26 to 29 in the capital city of Guiyang, southwest China's Guizhou Province, has set new records by being attended by 448 enterprises, among which are 156 foreign companies, including 39 Fortune 500 firms, the MIIT said on its website. As China's first big data pilot zone, the mountainous province of Guizhou, with its moderate climate, sufficient power supply and good network infrastructure, has attracted global tech giants to establish cloud computing and big data centers, as well as regional headquarters.
