As of Tuesday, 21 short video- or video-streaming platforms have such an anti-addiction system, especially for the youth, ahead of the country's Children's Day on Saturday.The CAC said on its website that the development marks a first for the anti-addiction system in long video platforms, and a universal standard would be applied to managing it to better protect teenagers and children in the country. The "youth mode" would limit young users' access to the platforms on time of use, and would only be allowed to visit a special content pool with quality and educational content.Movies and TV dramas that depict and promote heroic characters and patriotism would be a key source for the long video streaming content pool for the youth. For short video platforms, academic content, traditional culture, history and literature would be provided in the pool. Since the anti-addiction trial projects was introduced two months ago, some 460 million short video platform users have been receiving a window notice for youth mode, and 52.6 million visits using such a mode were made, an unnamed CAC official was quoted in the release as saying. The CAC also vowed to expand the coverage of young people-oriented anti-addiction to more business domains, such as livestreaming.
