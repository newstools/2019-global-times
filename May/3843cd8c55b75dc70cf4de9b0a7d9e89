The Chinese short track speed skating team vowed to win more gold medals at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games as skaters started their training for the new season. "Our job is to fight to win more gold medals for our country. Empty talk is useless, only hard work will lead us to the victory," said China head coach Li Yan on Thursday. Short track speed skaters contributed to 10 out of a total of 13 gold medals that Chinese athletes have won in the last five Winter Olympic Games, but failed to win a single title at the World Championships in 2019. "There is only one way to lose, that is to give up," she added. "I hope every skater can embrace the challenge and the test ahead with consistent hard work." Wu Dajing, who had become the first Chinese male skater to capture a gold medal at any Winter Olympic Games as he claimed the men's 500 meters in PyeongChang, was looking forward to having better performance in the next season after finishing runner-up in the last World Championships in Sofia in March. "Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't, this is sports," he said. "The only thing I want to do now is to focus on my training and get better prepared for the next season and hopefully I can achieve better results."
