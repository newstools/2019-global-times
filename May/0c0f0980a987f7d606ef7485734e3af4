Hu Ge Photo: ICPopular Chinese actor Hu Ge, whose suave looks made him the star of small screen imperial dramas, has tapped into a different side of himself for Wild Goose Lake, a gritty gangster flick competing for the top prize at the Cannes film festival.The Shanghai-born heartthrob plays the male lead in acclaimed Chinese director Diao Yinan's latest film, which follows the noirish vein of his Golden Bear-winning crime thriller Black Coal, Thin Ice (2014).Hu will be testing his acting chops against Hollywood stars Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio who star in Quentin Tarantino's new film, which is also in the running for the Palme d'Or.The dark role is different from the wholesome heroes Hu usually plays.Starring as a biker gang leader in Wild Goose Lake, Hu's character is his first lead role on the big screen following a stellar career on television.A string of hits has made him one of the highest-paid male actors on Chinese TV, commanding fees of around 100 million yuan ($14.7 million), Hong Kong news site HK01 reported in 2018.The new movie marks his return to the limelight after a hiatus to study in the US.Hu, 36, shot to fame in the Chinese mainland for his leading roles in wildly popular period series starting with the historical martial arts drama Chinese Paladin in 2005.But his meteoric rise was derailed by a tragic car accident the following year that killed his assistant and left him with severe injuries.The actor was left requiring reconstructive surgery, according to reports.In 2015, he starred in Nirvana in Fire, a TV adaptation of a Chinese online novel, which earned numerous awards and enjoyed wide commercial success in China.Chinese newspaper the Global Times even proclaimed that the show had restored people's confidence in period dramas.The actor eventually caught the eye of Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani and in 2017 became the face of clothing brand Emporio Armani in China and Asia.He epitomizes "the modern urban man combined with an elegant and dynamic look," the designer was quoted as saying by luxury fashion website Men's Folio.Hu also shot ads for a Swiss jeweler.All too aware of his pristine public persona, the actor and style icon revealed his desire to rebel against what has endeared him to so many fans."I really want to act as a bad guy or even a villain," he said in 2018."Since I have always played roles with nearly perfect personalities, I wonder if I could step into other ranges of characters, and somewhat subvert the stereotyped image on screen," he said.Newspaper headline: From heartthrob to bad boy Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Actress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame starDelegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growth
