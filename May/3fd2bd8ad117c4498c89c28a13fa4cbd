Weiss, the creators of HBO's Game of Thrones, and a separate trilogy by Last Jedi director Rian Johnson.A spokeswoman for Disney, contacted by AFP, did not offer additional details about the upcoming scheduled films, which will expand upon the cinematic universe created by George Lucas.Disney paid $4 billion for Lucasfilm in 2012.In September of 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted after the lackluster performance of Solo: A Star Wars Story, a one-off film in the franchise, that the Star Wars film release schedule was too frenetic.After six films in 38 years, from 1977 to 2005, the rhythm had picked up considerably. A total of four films came in rapid succession, from the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015 to Solo in May 2018."I made the timing decision, and as I look back, I think the mistake that I made - I take the blame - was a little too much, too fast," Iger told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.Meanwhile, the studio pushed back its plans for the next films in director James Cameron's uber-successful Avatar franchise - one of the biggest prizes for Disney in the Fox merger.Avatar 2 will come a year later than expected in December 2021, followed by Avatar 3 in 2023, Avatar 4 in 2025 and Avatar 5 in 2027.Avatar remains the top-grossing film of all time, with $2.79 billion in worldwide box-office sales, but superhero extravaganza Avengers: Endgame is hot on its heels at $2.24 billion and rapidly climbing.Newspaper headline: Hitting the brakes Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
