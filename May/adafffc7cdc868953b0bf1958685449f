Ricardo Freitas, CEO of SEMP TCL Photo: Xing Xiaojing/GTRicardo Freitas, a Brazilian executive, said he takes time every day to read the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a Chinese historical novel depicting warring kingdoms in the 2nd century."I am trying to figure out how the Chinese think," Freitas said.Freitas, CEO of SEMP TCL, the joint venture (JV) company set up by Chinese home appliance brand TCL and its local partner, is just one example of the process of mutual understanding between employees working at Chinese multinational companies in Brazil.In fact, respect for local consumers and the local natural environment has become a reason for the emerging success of Chinese companies in Brazil, a leading market in Latin America.TCL recorded its best performance in Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2018 with a 5.5 percent market share. The results were impressive, given that it was less than two and a half years ago that the company entered the Brazilian market, which is home to 210 million consumers and influences another 500 million in nearby countries and regions.TCL teamed up with Brazilian home appliance leader SEMP to explore the Brazilian market. A JV company, SEMP TCL, was set up in August 2016.But more needs to be done to make a dent in this distinctive market.Respect for localsFreitas told the Global Times that a strong focus on localization by the Chinese was behind the JV's sound performance.In fact, TCL requires its Chinese employees to eat the local food - a daunting task for homesick Chinese stomachs - and appreciate local poetry.Freitas said China and Brazil have markedly different cultures.The Chinese, however, are very open and frank in their exchange of opinions with the Brazilians. This inclusive culture has helped the company to make speedy decisions and run smoothly, and the JV turned a profit the year it was established.The JV produces TV sets, mobile phones and air conditioners.Yue Haiping, deputy general manager with SEMP TCL, told the Global Times that TCL products are specifically modified to meet the expectations of the local market. For instance, the company made changes to its products after it found Brazilian consumers are more focused on a mobile phone's practical features than its selfie retouch function. To boost the company's brand, the JV made Brazilian soccer star Neymar its brand ambassador. It also sponsors the Copa América football championship.The company's market share for TVs grew to 11 percent in 2018 from 2017's 8 percent, data the company provided to the Global Times showed.The feelings go both ways.Commenting on his literary adventures in his spare time, Freitas said, "The Chinese have long known to respect others, and they have long known cohesion could lead to great deeds."SEMP used to cooperate with Japanese investors. But China is a rising power. And Chinese investors' "make it happen" style of doing things has been a refreshing experience for Freitas, who had endured the stiff bureaucracy and dogmatism of the Japanese, who were a major foreign investor in Brazil.Cooperation with a Chinese company is the right choice, said Freitas.Yue said consumers in Latin America believe in "money for value." Low prices and sales gimmicks are not as effective as elsewhere.As more and more Chinese companies in Brazil bid farewell to their low price approach in favor of rooting themselves in the country, the region's growth potential will be high and TCL's investment will also be expanded, Yue said. TCL's TV sales in overseas markets reached 18.21 million units in 2018, data from the company's annual report showed. Sales volumes in both the North American market and the European market surged by over 40 percent year-on-year.In the past 10 years, over 200 Chinese companies have opened up branches in Brazil. China's investment in Brazil has grown at an average annual rate of 29 percent to reach a total of $40 billion, contributing to the country's economic leap, according to Li Jinzhang, former ambassador to Brazil.Respect for environmentIn 2015, the State Grid Corp of China won a bid to build a project for the second phase of a power transmission line at Belo Monte's large hydroelectric plant.The project will be the world's longest ultra-high-voltage electricity transmission line when completed, crossing 2,500 kilometers to bring Belo Monte's clean energy from Pará to major energy consumption areas in the southeast of the country.To honor its commitment to protect Brazil's biodiversity, the company spent 25 months participating in the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) review. Construction of the project itself only took 19 months.Cai Hongxian, chairman of State Grid Brazil Holding, said the company hired about 400 people to take part in the EIA review.Environmental assessment for the project was a hefty job. The long-distance power transmission project passes through three climate zones, from the Amazon rain forest to the Atlantic coast. It crossed 20 natural reserves, 863 rivers and many administrative localities. Brazilian law requires replanting vegetation removed during the construction process and transplanting of rare species.Cai said a single tree in the rain forest could have dozens of plants living on it. During the process, the EIA team identified 820 plant species. Among them, 40 tree species and 20 flower species were endangered.Following local law, the company set up a plant rescue center to protect endangered species and rehabilitated 1,100 hectares of vegetation.Chang Zhongjiao, general manager of the State Grid Brazil Holding, said the project team spent one year observing and recording the species and number of plants and animals in the rainforest and another six months conducting socioeconomic surveys on indigenous residents, population, economy, education, medical care and transportation. They held 11 EIA hearings in 10 cities along the route to make sure that the opinions of local government agencies and people were fully heard, according to Chang.The final environmental investigation report filled 56 volumes with over 100 gigabytes worth of data and 19 proposed programs such as geographical environmental protection, animal and plant protection and malaria prevention and control.The evaluation process also weathered political storms during the impeachment of former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. The project, once put into operation, can lower electricity prices to benefit the Brazilian people and provide stable power supply to Brazil, Chang said.By completing the toughest EIA in Brazilian history, State Grid was able to contribute its expertise to allocate clean energy across vast distances in the country, Cai said.Brazil is China's eighth-largest trading partner and China is the Latin American country's largest trading partner and export destination, according to China's Ministry of Commerce.Trade between China and Brazil was about $101.9 billion in the first 11 months of 2018, an increase of 27.1 percent on a yearly basis, according to Chinese customs data.China's exports to Brazil were up 18.8 percent year-on-year to $30.8 billion and imports rose 31 percent year-on-year to $71.1 billion during the same period. Newspaper headline: Taking root in Brazil Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Actress Liu honored with Hollywood Walk of Fame starDelegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growth
