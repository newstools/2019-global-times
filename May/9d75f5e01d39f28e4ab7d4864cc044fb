US aircraft manufacturer Boeing said Saturday that it is offering technical assistance in an investigation into the crash of a US commercial airplane in the state of Florida on Friday. "Boeing is providing technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as the agency conducts its investigation," the company said in a short statement. A Boeing 737-800 charter flight operated by Miami Air International skidded off a runway at Naval Air Station Jacksonville and crashed into the St. Johns River Friday evening. All 136 passengers and seven crew aboard the aircraft survived the impact, and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said in a tweet Friday that the plane was in "shallow water" and not "submerged." The NTSB sent a team of investigators Saturday to the crash site in northern Florida. The plane's flight data recorder was recovered on Saturday. The aircraft was a regular charter that runs weekly flights between the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and the Jacksonville Naval Air Station. It is unclear yet if the cause of the incident was similar to those of two deadly Boeing 737 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in recent months.
