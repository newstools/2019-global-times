However, in the geographical description, such sites were described "in India.""Ctrip has designated the South Tibet region as Indian territory by calling it 'Arunachal Pradesh'. Is it going to sell the country in such an open fashion," a netizen named baishuiwentianxia said on Sina Weibo on Wednesday."China's position on the China-India boundary question is consistent and clear-cut," said Hua Chunying, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in February, stressing that the Chinese government has never recognized the so-called Arunachal Pradesh.The incident comes after multiple cases of problematic maps which failed to show the correct territory of China were destroyed by the customs authorities in China.
