Mainland stocks rebounded on Tuesday morning after the Shanghai market experienced the biggest fall in about three years on Monday. As of the closing time of the morning session, the Shanghai Composite Index rose by 0.32 percent to 2,915.87 points, while the Shenzhen Component Index rose by   1.64 percent to 9,090.18 points. A total of 57 stocks rose to their daily trading limit of 10 percent on Tuesday morning, with agricultural shares leading the rally. The mainland's two bourses experienced a sharp fall on Monday, with the Shanghai market falling by 5.58 percent, while the Shenzhen market plunged by 7.56 percent. Experts have told the Global Times that the fall was caused by both a correction from a relatively large stock rise in earlier months, as well as by twists and turns in the China-US trade talks. Analysts from Goldman Sachs suggested that investors should continue to increase holdings of mainland stocks as Chinese policies often respond flexibly and timely to external changes, according to domestic media reports. Yang Delong, chief economist at the Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund Management Co, said that Monday's stock slide was mostly pushed by panicky sentiment on the market, but that wouldn't last long. "Now a bull market pattern has already firmed on the two mainland bourses. This won't be easily reversed by short-term sentiment fluctuations. I remain optimistic about A shares' future performance and believe they will soon stabilize and rebound," Yang told the Global Times. According to Yang, the leading "white horse" stocks, or blue-chip shares, are likely to lead in the rally.
