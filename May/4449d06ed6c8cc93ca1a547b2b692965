Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh on Monday met separately with Raul Castro, the first secretary of Cuba's Communist Party, and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, as part of his official visit to the Caribbean nation. Pham and Castro "discussed the historical and excellent relations between the peoples, parties and governments of both countries," said a government release broadcasted on the night news of Cuba's official television station. They also discussed "their respective experiences in the construction of socialism," according to the report. At Pham's meeting with Diaz-Canel, both sides expressed the willingness to boost their trade, economic and cooperation ties and address "international issues of common interest." During the day, Pham also met with Esteban Lazo, president of the People's Power National Assembly, Cuba's unicameral parliament, expressing Hanoi's interest to strengthen economic and commercial links with Havana. Pham's agenda in Cuba also included talks with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, during which both sides reaffirmed the historical links of brotherhood and trust between both countries, which established diplomatic relations in 1960. Shortly after their talks, the two officials signed an inter-foreign- ministries policy consultation plan for the period 2020-2022. Pham will conclude his trip to Cuba on Tuesday.
