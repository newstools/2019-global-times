Jinpa is the real endgame for Chinese art-house cinema, Luo Ping, a media analyst with the Communication University of China, told the Global Times.The Tibetan elements have also helped the movie stand out. Images of Bleak Hoh Basin, rough roads blurred by wild fog and wind, and slovenly men depict another side of Tibet that is totally different from the beautiful snow-covered plateau seen in most media.According to Pema Tseden, his goal was to display a Tibet where people are constantly struggling with modern civilization and traditional beliefs and show audiences that love and hatred, greed and obsession, and redemption and forgiveness also exist in this region often depicted as a spiritual heaven. Jinpa isn't the only Tibetan movie to have an impact on audiences. In 2017, Path of the Soul aroused admiration among Chinese moviegoers from outside the region. The film revolves around a group, including senior citizens, a child and a pregnant women, who set off from a remote village in Tibet on bowing pilgrimage - which requires them to touch their heads to the ground after each step - to the regional capital of Lhasa and then further on to Kang Rinpoche, one of the major holy mountains in Tibetan Buddhism.The movie won a great deal of applause from audiences, especially from moviegoers living in urban areas, who found the discussion of Tibetan Buddhism and faith touching and reflective. Despite the odds, Path of the Soul surpassed 100 million yuan ($14.8 million) at the box office, while its rating on Douban reached 7.8/10.Future of ethnic filmIf producers and directors want to make more successful movies featuring Tibet and other ethnic minority groups, then they must find ways to connect their films to the outside world, said Pema Tseden.For a long time, films have acted as a channel for people to learn more about the lives of ethnic minority groups, and many film insiders believe films featuring these groups have continued to grow over time, Xiong Kunxin, an ethnic studies professor at Tibet University in Lhasa, told the Global Times.Xiong said that the cultural strategic significance of ethnic minority films should not be underestimated and that these films have made undeniable contributions to the harmony, unity and mutual development of China's 56 ethnic groups.The government has also been working to support the development of movies featuring ethnic minority groups.The year 2016 saw the introduction of the Film Industry Promotion Law, which encourages and supports the production of films on ethnic minority subjects and seeks to strengthen efforts in dubbing and subtitling of films into minority languages. However, some obstacles still stand in the way. "Capital is the biggest problem," China Film Association Secretary-General Rao Shuguang was quoted by the Xinhua News Agency as saying in November 2018.The issue of money is a problem for every link in the industry chain from casting and shooting to marketing, said Rao, noting that some local governments have signed deal with cinemas to expand slots for ethnic minority films. Rao also advocated that these films should be judged on other criterion besides performance at the box office. Cultural and aesthetic factors should be considered when appreciating these films, which is sure to help promote the healthy development of ethnic minority film in China, Xinhua reported. Newspaper headline: Different perspectives Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
