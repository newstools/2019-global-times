Two Reuters journalists, who were arrested for illegally obtaining and possessing government documents in December 2017, were released as part of the Myanmar presidential amnesty to 6,520 prisoners on Tuesday, according to the President's Office.The two Yangon-based journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from Reuters, were sentenced to seven years in September 2018 for breaching the Official Secrets Act.They were arrested for possessing important and secret government documents with regard to the Rakhine state and security forces and intending to send them to the foreign news agency.Meanwhile, the presidential amnesty has brought the total prisoners released since Myanmar's traditional New Year last month to 23,019.Â Wa Lone, 33, thanked people from "around the world" for advocating for their release and vowed he would return to work."I can't wait to go to my newsroom," he said. "I am a journalist and I am going to continue."Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen Adler said: "We are enormously pleased that Myanmar has released our courageous reporters.""Since their arrests 511 days ago, they have become symbols of the importance of press freedom around the world. We welcome their return."A government spokesperson told reporters that family members had sent letters to Myanmar's State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint."After leaders took into consideration the long-term interest of [the] country, two Reuters journalists were released," spokesperson Zaw Htay said.The two men waved and smiled broadly as they walked out of the jail.Military spokesman Zaw Min Tun said it had no comment on the release except that the case was "undertaken in line with the law."Their families were overjoyed with the news."We are very happy," Chit Su Win, who is married to Kyaw Soe Oo, told AFP. A reunion photo of both couples celebrating, smiling and holding each of their daughters was widely shared on Twitter.During their imprisonment, the journalists were showered with numerous awards and honors in response to their work.Last month, they won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize.Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were also featured earlier on the cover of TIME magazine as part of its person of the year coverage featuring journalists targeted for their reporting.The now-former officer Moe Yan Naing told AFP he was "delighted" the families were back together, and expressed interest in meeting the journalists if they wanted to.Media advocates and rights organizations praised the release but slammed the original arrest and conviction."We congratulate Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo on walking free from unjust imprisonment and applaud they have now been reunited with their families," said Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director, adding they should have "never been arrested" in the first place.
