Seven South Korean tourists died and 21 others were missing after a sightseeing boat sank in driving rain on the Danube river in the heart of Budapest, officials said Thursday.The boat capsized near the parliament building in the Hungarian capital after a collision with a larger cruise boat on Wednesday evening, officials and media reports said.Army divers joined police in the hunt for survivors, which continued through the night.The search operation has been extended the length of the Danube in Hungary, officials said, as weeks of heavy rainfall has led to high water levels and a fast-moving current, complicating rescue efforts.Local media reported that one body was found several kilometers south of the site of the sinking, although this was not confirmed by the emergency services.A total of 33 South Koreans including 30 tourists and three guides were on board the Mermaid, Seoul's foreign ministry said, confirming the seven dead were Korean.The youngest on board was a 6-year-old girl, travel agency officials said.The 26-meter boat was also carrying two Hungarian crew members when it went down at 9:15 pm.Emergency services spokesman Pal Gyorfi said that in addition to the seven dead, another seven people were taken to hospital with symptoms of hypothermia and shock.Police spokesman Kristof Gal told AFP that a further 21 were missing."The government expresses its condolences to the families of the South Korean victims of the Danube boat accident," the Hungarian government said on its Facebook page."The government is providing all possible help to the police, emergency services, divers, ambulance staff and doctors treating the survivors."Â South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha was to leave later Thursday for Budapest as head of a government taskforce, his office said.A witness told the Index.hu news site that the Mermaid, which could carry up to 60 people, had been hit from behind by a large cruise boat.Web camera footage from a hotel rooftop posted on local news sites appeared to show the larger vessel colliding with the Mermaid.
