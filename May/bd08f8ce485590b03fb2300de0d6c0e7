North Macedonia returned to the ballot box Sunday for a presidential run-off that risks turning into a major headache for the ruling Social Democrats, whose candidate is battling a nationalist-backed rival.Turnout figures will be as important as who wins, with 40 percent of the electorate needed to vote to validate the poll.The two candidates, the ruling party's Stevo Pendarovski and right-wing favorite Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, finished in a near dead heat in the first round last month.Their tie reflected a split between pro-West and nationalist camps who have clashed over the government's recent move to change the country's name to North Macedonia, which ended a long-running row with Greece.But record-low turnout in the first round, at barely over 41 percent, also reflected a failure to galvanize most of the 1.8 million voters.If turnout sinks below 40 percent this time, the entire poll will be annulled, threatening a new period of political uncertainty in one of Europe's poorest states."The country has been divided for a long time and I think one of the first duties of the new president must be to work to reduce this division," 70-year-old voter Roza Jovanova said after casting her ballot in the capital Skopje on a drizzly Sunday morning.Prime Minister Zoran Zaev is confident "the elections will succeed." But if not, he said he would call a snap parliamentary poll.
