The United States has increased political and economic pressures against Iran which are unprecedented in the history of the country since the victory of the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Rouhani said. He noted that the current wave of pressures on Iran is even more difficult than the pressures Iran experienced during the war with Iraq in 1980s. "At the time of the Iran-Iraq war, we had no problem in (international) banking transactions, sales of oil, exports and imports," he said, adding that at that time, "the only ban imposed on us was the arms embargo." However, "we should not accept submission (to US pressures) and we should try to find a solution," said Rouhani. The Iranian president urged unity and solidarity among political groups.
