The European Union (EU)'s report on Macao contained groundless and irresponsible claims, and made inappropriate comments about Macao's internal affairs, the Office of the Government Spokesperson of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China said on Friday. The SAR government expressed its strong opposition after the release of the 2018 annual report on the Macao SAR issued by the EU. "Foreign authorities and foreign countries have no right to interfere in China's domestic affairs, and should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of Macao. The SAR government demands the EU stop this wrong practice," the spokesperson's office said. "Since its establishment, the Macao SAR has strictly adhered to the principles of 'one country, two systems', 'Macao people administering Macao' with a high degree of autonomy. The SAR has been developing effectively under the regulations of the Constitution of China and the Basic Law of Macao." The spokesperson's office added that the successful implementation of the above principles had been effective in maintaining the Macao SAR's prosperity and making remarkable achievements in various aspects. "The SAR government's effort in protecting the rights and freedoms of Macao residents as stipulated in the Constitution of China and the Basic Law of Macao. These achievements and objective facts have been recognized by anyone holding an unbiased view."
