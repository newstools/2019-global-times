We hope to use the advantage and make it a key direction of Macao's future development."Openness and attraction Macao has formed a unique landscape that combines views from the East and the West: luxury modern hotels, Portuguese architecture in old town and old Cantonese buildings in the lanes. With the acceleration of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area construction, the openness and attraction of Macao is ever increasing.Chan, the director, said that gambling still contributes a lot to Macao's economy.
