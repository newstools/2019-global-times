The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired unidentified short-range projectiles off its east coast Saturday morning, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Several projectiles were launched towards the northeast from the DPRK's east coast city of Wonsan for 21 minutes from about 9:06 a.m. local time (0006 GMT), the JCS said in a statement. The projectiles traveled some 70 km to 200 km into the eastern waters. Further details were being analyzed by the military authorities of South Korea and the United States. It was originally reported that the DPRK fired a short-range missile, but it was later revised into several short-range projectiles. The JCS said the South Korean military intensified defense readiness and surveillance in preparation for the DPRK's possibly additional launches, adding that it maintained a full readiness in close cooperation with the United States. It was the first missile launch in around 17 months since the DPRK test-fired Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in November 2017.
