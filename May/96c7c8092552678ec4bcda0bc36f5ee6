A contemporary Chinese art exhibition was inaugurated on Tuesday in Cuba's capital Havana, offering local people an opportunity to learn Chinese views on life and see artworks up close. Themed "Faces around us in silence", the exhibition of more than 50 artworks by three contemporary Chinese artists -- Yue Minjun, Lou Min and Wu Yuan -- opened at the Palacio de Lombillo Museum located in a historic district in Havana and will run until June 28. "My paintings feature rich colors and strong contrast between lights and shadows, just like the visual impression this country brings me, which has intense sunlight," Yue, who visits Cuba for the first time, told Xinhua. In the view of critical realism, the artists use different techniques such as lithographs, oil on canvas and ink on rice paper, depicting faces and characters in the works that reflect their inner world and individual pursuits. "Art is always a universal language, no matter what distance between the artists and the audience," said Zhao Xiaoming, cultural advisor of the Chinese embassy in Cuba, at the opening ceremony. The artworks help "strengthen the bond of cultural exchange and promote understanding and friendship between the Chinese and the Cuban people," Zhao said. The establishment of exchanges between China and Cuba can be traced back to the 19th century when Chinese migrants first landed on the island, which partly explains why the Cubans are keen to appreciate the Chinese art and update their knowledge of the Asian country. Aliana Martinez, curator of the museum, described the exhibition as a "gift" for Cubans, saying "it (the exhibition) is very important because sometimes we have the cliche of seeing China only as an ancient nation, while actually there are also many contemporary artists displaying their modern new life."
