A late night bar shooting killed one and injured two others in the US state of Florida, according to local police. The shooting took place at a bar in the city Fort Lauderdale just before midnight Wednesday, the city's police spokesperson Casey Liening said, suggesting the shooting to be the result of an altercation. Liening lauded the people at the bar for jumping on the shooter to prevent further casualties. The shooting brought back horrific memories from a 2016 bar shooting in the city of Orlando, where a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 in one of the most deadly mass shootings in US history.
