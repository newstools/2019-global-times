About 90 percent of Chinese parents are concerned how their children spend 10-minute breaks between classes, according to a survey released by the China Youth Daily Thursday. Among 1,908 surveyed parents of primary and secondary school students, 66.7 percent said they would encourage children to take a rest during recess and 62.4 percent would take their children to get more physical exercise after school. As children are not allowed to play outside but must stay in the classroom during break time in some schools, 73 percent of respondents were worried that their children's pressure couldn't be relieved, while 53.6 percent expressed concerns over their children's eyesight in such circumstances. The survey showed that parents of primary school students are more concerned about the break time than those of the secondary school students.
