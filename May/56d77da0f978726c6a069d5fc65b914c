Prosecutors of China's six provincial-level regions have set up a cooperative mechanism to strengthen judicial protection of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) has said.The mechanism established by the procuratorates of Chongqing, Sichuan Province, Guizhou Province, Yunnan Province, Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province will better protect the ecological environment of the region by focusing on case handling, according to the SPP, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday.Prosecutors have vowed to punish crimes that damage the ecological environment and handle cases which the people are strongly concerned about.Â Supervision over lawsuits related to the ecological environment will be strengthened and the unique role of public interest litigation will be performed, said Xinhua.Prosecutors will also step up efforts to establish platforms to coordinate jurisdiction, enhance cooperation in case handling and share information.China earlier this year unveiled an action plan to protect and restore the Yangtze River with goals including eliminating more than 90 percent of "black and odorous" water bodies in cities at or above prefecture level in the Yangtze River economic belt by the end of 2020.In March this year, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng called on officials to take concrete measures to protect and restore the Yangtze River's ecological environment.At a symposium attended by provincial and ministerial level officials, Han stressed that all economic activities related to the river should not damage its ecological environment, and a green, ecological and sustainable path should be pursued in developing the region, according to a previous report from Xinhua.He pointed out that the Yangtze River's ecological environment still faces a severe situation, as an inspection last year revealed serious problems such as pollution emission and ecological damage in the region.
