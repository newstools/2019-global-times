A total of 150 Fijians have been killed from speeding alone in the last five years as 5,000 traffic infringement notices are issued to drivers for speeding every month, Fiji's Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Wednesday. LTA Chief Executive Samuel Simpson said that speeding is the biggest single cause of fatalities in the island nation with a population of around 900,000 people. The deaths has forced LTA to step up its enforcement measures, he said, adding that LTA is now installing automatic number plate recognition speed cameras around Fiji. The cameras are being tested and contains xenon light which flashes so the radar detector works out the speed of the vehicle using complex algorithm and it flashes to take photograph and video clips. The clip and the photograph of the vehicle including the number plate and the driver as well as date is then transmitted back to the LTA's traffic enforcement unit. LTA hopes that this measure would decrease speeding in Fiji to save lives.
