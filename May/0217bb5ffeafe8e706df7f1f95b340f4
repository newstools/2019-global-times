A subway line in central China has been covered by 5G networks of the country's top three telecom operators, sources said. This is the first such attempt across the country, according to China Tower, China's telecommunication tower infrastructure services provider. Average downloading traffic speed reached 700 Mbps at the Line 5 subway station in Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan Province. The successful implementation by China Mobile, China Union and China Telecom in Zhengzhou is expected to offer a reliable reference for such practices of Chinese and global telecom operators. China's telecom operators have been stepping up investment in the development and applications of 5G technologies to gain a foothold in the emerging market. Friday marked the World Telecommunications Day and the World Information Society Day, which fall on May 17 every year.
