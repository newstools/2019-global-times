Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was hit with an egg by a woman on Tuesday, during a campaign stop for the upcoming federal election. Morrison was greeting members of the Country Women's Association (CWA) in the regional town of Albury when the 25-year-old woman approached him from behind and propelled the egg at his head. Fortunately for the prime minister, the egg bounced off him without breaking and was later recovered intact. An elderly woman was knocked to the ground as security members scrambled to catch the offender, only to be helped to her feet afterwards by Morrison himself. "My concern about today's incident in Albury was for the older lady who was knocked off her feet," Morrison later posted online. "I helped her up and gave her a hug." The protester is reported to have no affiliation with the CWA and was taken into custody by police. Earlier in the year, controversial Australian Senator Fraser Anning was also hit with an egg in a similar attack. The Australian federal election will be held on May 18.
