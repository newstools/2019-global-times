Six men who were sentenced to death for killing multiple people and using their bodies to file fake insurance claims were executed on April 12, according to a notice released by Linfen People's Intermediate Court in North China's Shanxi Province. The men were convicted for murdering 11 miners and cheating insurance companies out of $460,371 during a killing spree that began in 2007 and ended November 2014, thepaper.cn reported on Sunday.During the eight-year run, the group committed at least 12 violent crimes in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. The victims were persuaded to enter lower mining pits where they were killed with tools or explosive blasts. Only one of their victims survived.  The court notice said the men received death sentences and were deprived political rights for life at the court's first ruling. An appeal was filed afterward but was later dismissed. Liang Jun'an, a procurator who worked on the case, wrote an article for jcrb.com news platform in August 2017, claiming the victims were local migrant workers from impoverished backgrounds.  The victims were handpicked for two specific reasons, according to Liang. Poor migrant workers do not return home as often as others so they can save more money. Their minimal contact with relatives meant they would not be reported missing after they were killed. Fellow residents were also chosen because their similar regional accents, making it easier for the killers to pass themselves off as family members when asking insurance companies for compensation following the staged mining accidents.
