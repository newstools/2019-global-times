Many people said they were jealous of him and wanted to go as well.During the International Workers' Day holidays, the number of Chinese tourists who visited the film locations increased remarkably. The most expensive travel package costs $4,789.Among them, the number of tourists to Croatia who booked on Ctrip rose by 450 percent year-on-year, the biggest and fastest growth among all six sites. The number of tourists to Iceland increased 140 percent, and those who visited Morocco increased 107 percent.
