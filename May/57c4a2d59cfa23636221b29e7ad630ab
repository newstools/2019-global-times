A neonatal department has been shut down following the deaths of five newborn babies in April at a hospital in Foshan, South China's Guangdong Province. Head and secretary of the Party committee of Southern Medical University's Shunde Hospital and a deputy director of Shunde district health bureau have been removed from post, according to a statement released by Foshan health authorities on Saturday.The five deaths in April resulted from neonatal infections and 13 more infected babies had been cured and discharged according to the investigation launched by local health authorities.One patient remained in a stable condition and no new infection had been found at any local hospital as of press time.Reopening date of the neonatal department of Shunde hospital has not been decided, a liaison staff member who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday. The investigation said the deaths resulted from the hospital's laxness including an unsound mechanism for infection prevention and control, absence of monitoring of infected patients at the neonatal department and a failure to report infections as required.Local health authorities urged the hospital to follow up on treatment of the infected patients and care for those family members involved in the incidents. Claiming he was the father of a newborn, internet user wuchangqi on April 23 posted on WeChat that a few days after birth, his baby suffered from an enterovirus, a commonly encountered infection in infants and children. The child died from internal bleeding, brain hemorrhage and multiple organ failure, he noted. The father alleged two other newborns had died with similar symptoms in the past month and suggested they were all infected at the hospital.  The post sparked a public outcry, prompting the hospital April 24 to issue a statement on its website offering its deep regret and sadness at the tragic death of the newborns. The hospital vowed to cooperate with any investigation.
