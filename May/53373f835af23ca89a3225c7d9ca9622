Photo:ICStandards and industry organizations should uphold the principle of openness and should not bar any company for political purposes, Chinese tech firm Huawei said in response to its membership suspension by several industry associations. "The products and services provided by Huawei now and in the future will not be affected by individual organizations and their actions, which are contrary to the principles of transparency, openness and non-discrimination," Huawei said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Sunday, after it had reportedly been suspended from several US-based standards organizations such as Wi-Fi Alliance, which certificates Wi-Fi products, and JEDEC, which sets specifications for various USB and RAM standards."Open and unified standards promote synergy between industry chains… and industry achievements are inseparable from the contributions and joint efforts of many open organizations such as standards organizations, open source communities and industry alliances," Huawei said in the statement. The latest suspension followed the US government sanctions on the Chinese company, which is also a major contributor to international ICT and 5G standards. Wi-Fi Alliance has not responded to an interview request sent by the Global Times over the weekend. In spite of the US-led global clampdown, Huawei said it will continue to actively work with global standards and industrial organizations and advocate for an open and sustainable environment.
