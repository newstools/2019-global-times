Indian President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday dissolved the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, thus paving the way for the constitution of the next house after the just-concluded 17th general elections. Election results were announced on Friday, declaring the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National Democratic Alliance (NDA) registering a spectacular victory, by winning in more than 350 constituencies out of the 542 that went to polls. A press communique issued by the President's Office said that the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday passed a resolution to advise the president to dissolve the 16th Lok Sabha with immediate effect. "The President has accepted the advice of the Cabinet and signed the Order dissolving the 16th Lok Sabha in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by Sub-clause (b) of Clause (2) of Article 85 of the Constitution," added the press communique. In India's political set-up, the term of Lok Sabha is fixed for five years, while the parliament's upper house Rajya Sabha is a permanent chamber. Meanwhile, in another related development, the winning lawmakers belonging to the NDA are slated to meet later Saturday evening to appoint Narendra Modi as their leader, who would subsequently assume the office of prime minister for his second consecutive term.
