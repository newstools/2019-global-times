The government is giving wide support to the private economy and believes it will continue to prosper just as China's development originated from Xibaipo and will continue to boom despite difficulties, Bai said.Newspaper headline: Young entrepreneurs study CPC revolution spirit Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Contribution rememberedChild porn arrests shock S.California Chinese communityUtah celebrates 150th birthday of Transcontinental Railroad
