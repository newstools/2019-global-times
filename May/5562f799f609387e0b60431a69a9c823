The office said it aimed to lift more than 140,000 poverty-stricken rural residents out of poverty by the year end, and assist 20 impoverished banners and counties cast off the poor label. Favorable policies and poverty relief funds are being poured into poor areas in Inner Mongolia to develop featured industries, support financing and train talents, the office added. Collaboration between Inner Mongolia and its neighboring municipality of Beijing in poverty alleviation has been strengthened in a bid to create more anti-poverty projects, promote technology and talent exchanges, and expand the market for the autonomous region's agricultural products. China is set to build a moderately prosperous society by 2020. To achieve the goal, the country needs to lift around 30 million poor rural residents out of poverty between 2018 and 2020.
