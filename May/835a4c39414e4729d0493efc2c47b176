China's central bank on Tuesday resumed open market operations to inject liquidity into the money market after suspension for five consecutive trading days. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) conducted 80 billion yuan (about 11.6 billion US dollars) of seven-day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2.55 percent. No reverse repo is due on Tuesday. A reverse repo is a process by which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future. China will keep its prudent monetary policy "neither too tight nor too loose" while maintaining market liquidity at a reasonably ample level in 2019.
