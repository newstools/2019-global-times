It was not an individual or partisan or governmental issue. Rather, It was a national decision which was made by the entire governing system," said Rouhani, adding the nuclear deal was to the interest of the world and the region, but the enemies of Iran pressed US to withdraw from it.The Iranian president made the remarks at the cabinet meeting on live TV broadcast to mark the first anniversary of the US unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal (May 8, 2018).Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Abbas Araqchi on the same day delivered Rouhani's letter to ambassadors of the states parties to JCPOA.The letter informed the ambassadors about Iran Supreme National Security Council's decision on scale-down of commitments to the JCPOA.Meanwhile in a separate letter, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif informed the European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini of the details of Iran reciprocal action.
