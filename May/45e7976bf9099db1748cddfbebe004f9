Pyongyang's determination for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged if Washington takes a new stand in future negotiations, said a senior official of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) here on Tuesday. "When the time comes, we will put it into practice. But this is possible only under the condition that the US changes their current method of calculation and formulates a new stand," said Choe Son Hui, vice minister of the DPRK's Foreign Ministry. Choe said the US maximum pressure and economic blockade on the DPRK were not working. "We could wait until the end of this year to see whether the US makes a courageous decision," the vice foreign minister said. "In case the US is messing the problem and wandering along the other road like what it is doing right now, and would not formulate their position anew within the time frame set by our side, they will indeed face an undesired consequence," she warned. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with CBS last week that Washington could "change paths" if the DPRK did not bring "real conversations" on abandoning its nuclear arsenal to the negotiation table. The second summit meeting between DPRK top leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in late February in Hanoi, Vietnam failed to reach a deal on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and high-level negotiations between the two sides also went to a standstill.
