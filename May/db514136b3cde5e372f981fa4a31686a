A Chinese envoy on Monday asked the international community to stick to the two-state solution so as to tackle the Palestinian-Israeli issue from the root.The international community should promote the settlement of the question of Palestine with a view to establishing a fully sovereign state of Palestine, based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital. Any new initiative put forward should be in conformity with the parameters, said Ma Zhaoxu, China's permanent representative to the United Nations.He called for unity of the international community in pushing for an early restart of the peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.

The settlement construction must stop. Parties concerned should avoid any action or rhetoric that may exacerbate the situation, or any move that may undermine trust, so as to create the necessary conditions for the early resumption of dialogue, Ma told an open debate of the Security Council.Parties that have influence in the Middle East should play a constructive role and refrain from taking any unilateral action that further escalates the tension in the region, said the Chinese ambassador.He also asked for efforts to promote intra-Palestinian reconciliation and to actively explore new ways to facilitate peace in the Middle East so as to bring the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks out of the deadlock.He asked the international community to pay close attention to and work to improve the economic and humanitarian situation of the Palestinians.The question of Palestine is at the core of the Middle East issue and the fundamental question for the region. It is the common responsibility of the international community to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Palestinian people, said Ma.
