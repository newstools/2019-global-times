Two days before voting begins in European parliamentary elections, national leaders were scrambling to mobilize their supporters to resist a populist challenge on Tuesday.European governments fear a good showing for euroskeptics in the vote, which begins on Thursday and runs to Sunday, will disrupt Brussels decision-making.Opinion polls predict a significant advance for nationalist and populist forces opposed to closer EU integration and threatening mainstream reform efforts.French President Emmanuel Macron called the vote the most important European parliamentary election since the first in 1979 and warned the EU faces "an existential threat."Turnout has fallen in each EU vote since 1979, and mainstream leaders hope Britain's Brexit spectacle and a scandal for the Austrian far-right will mobilize voters.The outgoing president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged an audience at a trade union convention in Vienna "to fight where it is worth fighting.""And it is worth making it clear for the next decades - also in the coming European elections - that trade unionists, social democrats and Christian democrats, others should stand there like one man when it comes to pushing back the danger from the extreme right," he said.Â British voters - along with the Dutch - will vote first on Thursday, with those in the 26 other member states following suit over the next three days.
