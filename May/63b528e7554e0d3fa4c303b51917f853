Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives are in fourth place on 11 percent.Had Britain left the European Union as planned on March 29, it would not be taking part in the European Parliament elections, which will be held in the UK on May 23.In the 2016 referendum on Britain's EU membership, 52 percent voted to leave while 48 percent voted to remain.Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said Remain voters were scattered among several parties."While 63 percent of Leavers say they will vote for the Brexit Party in the European elections, the most popular party among Remainers [Labour] only has 31 percent, versus 22 percent for the Lib Dems and 14 percent for the Greens," he said.Brexit voters have deserted the Conservatives to such an extent that they now have a higher share of Remainers (12 percent) backing them than of Leavers (11 percent), he added.In voting intentions for the next general election - which must be held by May 2022 - left-wing Labour is on 28 percent, the center-right Conservatives on 22 percent, the Brexit Party on 21 percent and the centrist Liberal Democrats on 11 percent.Opinium Research conducted an online survey of 2,004 British adults between Wednesday and Friday. The results were weighted.A ComRes general election poll, which appears in The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, puts Labour on 27 percent, the Brexit Party on 20 percent and the Conservatives on 19 percent.The poll of 2,034 adults conducted on Thursday was commissioned by Brexit Express, a campaign group run by the Brexit Party's biggest donor.Prime Minister May has pledged to step down once a Brexit divorce deal has been agreed upon by parliament.
