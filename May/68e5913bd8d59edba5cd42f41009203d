Several people were killed and 45 others injured after Taliban attacked a provincial police station in Pul-e-Khumri, capital of Afghanistan's northern province of Baghlan on Sunday, sources said."At least seven Taliban were involved in the attack. Five of the assailants were killed as one bomber detonated a hijacked military vehicle outside Baghlan Police Station roughly at 12:45 p.m. local time, paving the way for second group of assailants to enter the building," a security official, Abbas Tawakoli, told Xinhua.Two attackers blew themselves up inside the station and two militants were shot and killed by security forces, he said."The clashes were ongoing inside the facility as of afternoon as security forces were battling the remaining Taliban militants," he said.The blast is the latest in a string of bombings that have targeted dozens of military and security compounds across the country.Up to 45 injured, including women and children, were shifted to a main hospital in the city after the huge blast, according to Haleem Ghafari, a provincial health official.He said further details on casualties would be shared with media later in the day.The blast also damaged buildings, shops and several cars in the city, 160 km north of the country's capital, Kabul.Taliban militants claimed responsibility for the attack shortly after the incident.The Taliban-led insurgency has been on the rampage since early April when the militant group launched a yearly rebel offensive.
