Walkden capitalized on Zheng's defensive tactics, but Zheng did not change the way she fought, Xiao noted.News of Zheng's loss has reached Chinese social media, with many netizens questioning the referee's double standards. "What a dirty game, Zheng's gold medal was stolen!" said a netizen on Weibo.  Some international netizens sympathized with Zheng, while the Global Times reporter found Walkden turned off the comments feature of her latest Instagram post.
