A sculpture by US artist Jeff Koons sold on Wednesday for $91.1 million at an auction organized by Christie's in New York - a record price for a living artist.Rabbit, a stainless steel casting of an inflatable rabbit, overtook the previous record set by British painter David Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which sold in November 2018 at Christie's for $90.3 million.It was a return to the top for Koons, whose Balloon Dog (Orange) for five years held the record for highest price reached at auction for a living artist after its 2013 sale for $58.4 million.The selling price of Rabbit was only $80 million, but once commissions and fees were added, the final total rose to $91.07 million.In an unusual turn for an art auction at this price range, the buyer of Rabbit was actually in the room during the sale.Produced by Koons in 1986, Rabbit is among the best-known works by the artist, who built a reputation for challenging art world conventions.At 1.04 meters in height, the figure was auctioned from the collection of deceased publishing mogul S.I. Newhouse.Before his death in 2017, his empire included Conde Nast, which published magazines like Vogue, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair.
