Iran is not concerned about the recent US sanctions on Tehran's metal exports, Iranian Deputy Minister of Industry, Mining and Trade Jafar Sarqini said Saturday. Recent sanctions by the US government on the sales of Iran's iron, steel, aluminum, and copper will have less significant impact on the country's metal industry, Sarqini told Tasnim news agency. "Iran's metal industry has high-quality and meets global standards ... and it has its customers in the world," the Iranian deputy minister said. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump imposed new sanctions targeting Iran's revenue from export of industrial metals. The US move followed Iran's withdrawal from parts of its commitments under the landmark 2015 international nuclear deal.
