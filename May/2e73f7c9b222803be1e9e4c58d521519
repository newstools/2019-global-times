A report into a 2015 New Zealand helicopter crash that claimed seven lives criticized the aviation regulator on Thursday for lax oversight that allowed an inadequately trained pilot to operate scenic flights.The Airbus AS350 chopper crashed into the South Island's Fox Glacier, killing all aboard including a New Zealand pilot, four Britons and two Australians. Investigators found no single definitive cause for the crash but pointed to multiple failings by the pilot, operator J.P. Scott and the regulator.Bad weather in the rugged area meant the flight should never have taken place and the conditions probably caused the pilot to misjudge the aircraft's distance from the ground.The inquiry found the operator's training practices were "ill-defined," the pilot did not have the experience to be flying in such a challenging environment, and the aircraft was overloaded. But it reserved its strongest criticism for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which it said knew about Scott's safety breaches but failed to act."The operator had been allowed to continue providing helicopter air operations with little or no intervention from the CAA, in spite of the authority having identified significant noncompliances," it said.It raised concerns the watchdog may have allowed other operators to get away with similar breaches and called for an independent review of CAA's surveillance activities.
