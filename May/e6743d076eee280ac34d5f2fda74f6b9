Brazilian violinist Alessandro Borgomanero performed his solo violin recital From Bach to the Brazilian Masters at the National Center for the Performing Arts (NCPA) in Beijing on Wednesday. Borgomanero is one of the most talented soloists in Brazil. His performance was held as part of a series of events hosted by the Embassy of Brazil in Beijing to introduce Brazilian culture to China. Before each piece, the violinist gave a brief introduction so the audience could appreciate the work of the Brazilian composers who wrote them. While Borgomanero has performed at the Kremlin in Moscow and Carnegie Hall in New York, this was the first time he has ever performed in China. During his week-long trip, the musician also gave a concert in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province, as well as held a master class on Tuesday for students at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, China's leading music school."I was very happy to see how talented the kids are and how interested they are in music," Borgomanero told the Global Times. "I've never performed with orchestras in China. I would love to, especially, work with the orchestra at the Conservatory," he added.
