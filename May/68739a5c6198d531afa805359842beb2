China's Huawei Technologies Co has in recent weeks mounted a very vocal response to a US ban. But more than just words, the company has also taken concrete actions to prepare for the long game.Despite tremendous pressure from the US government, Huawei has been ratcheting up recruitment of talent, particularly specialists in areas such as smartphone operating systems (OS) and semiconductors, showcasing the company's bet on talent for a breakthrough and underscoring its incredible resilience that has inspired many not just in China but around the world.On Saturday, Huawei's Central Software Institute posted job ads on its official WeChat account for 10 positions covering areas such as artificial intelligence and smartphone OS.The jobs will be based in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, where the company is based. The post did not say how many people it was looking to hire.In a clear sign of Huawei's focus on its own mobile OS, the institute said it was looking for talent to take part in the research and development of Linux systems, open source OS, and next-generation of OS, which it will use to build a new ecosystem for the new OS."Obviously, in light of the recent threat that Google might stop supplying the Android system to Huawei, Huawei naturally wants to speed things up for the launch its own OS," said Fu Liang, a veteran telecom industry analyst.Google stoked fear last week when it announced that it would cut off its Android services to Huawei in compliance with the US government's ban. Google has since announced a temporary reprieve, but that has not halted speculation and anticipation about Huawei's own OS.Richard Yu Chengdong, head of Huawei's consumer business, confirmed that Huawei will launch its own OS as early as this fall and no later than spring 2020. Huawei's OS is reported called "HongMeng OS" and it has been in the testing phase for a while.Huawei has also stepped up effort to hire talent for semiconductors and other crucial areas. HiSilicon, the semiconductor arm of Huawei, also launched a global talent hunt to last week in an apparent bid to beef up research and development in chips following the US ban."This is very promising. I think this is Huawei saying that it is not going anywhere," Fu said, noting that "though this might be a slow process but talent will decide the ultimate fate of Huawei."
