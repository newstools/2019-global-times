U.S. Photo: XinhuaChinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday slammed "someone in the US side" who makes endless attacks on China, in response to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's frequent accusations against China at different international occasions. Geng Shuang, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a routine press conference on Thursday that "someone on the US side" raised their old endless talk to tarnish the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). "They (some individuals on the US side) are not tired of talking, but we are tired of hearing it, and they should not overestimate their capability on creating rumors, and don't underestimate others' ability to judge," Geng said.Geng made the remarks after Pompeo accused China at a speech in the UK.According to the Guardian, Pompeo told UK officials on Wednesday at a speech in London, "Ask yourself: would the Iron Lady [former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher] be silent if China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption or coercion?" and "Would she welcome the Belt and Road Initiative without demanding absolute transparency and the highest standards?" Geng said if US politicians want to continue their endless talk, then just let them, and China will keep doing what it should do. "Who is the spoiler and who is the doer? I think the international community has the answer."Diao Daming, an assistant professor at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said that China should be alert because Pompeo's views could affect the policymaking circle of the White House and could become the US view, rendering the US 'the country' that fails to represent the mainstream of international community."
