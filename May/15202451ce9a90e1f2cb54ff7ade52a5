China on Monday said it always maintained the position that any trade consultation with the United States should be based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang made the remarks at a press briefing in response to US President Donald Trump's recent remarks. Trump, who is visiting Japan, said earlier Monday that Washington was not ready to make a trade deal with Beijing. Lu said for some time, the US side, including some high-level personnel, has made various comments on China-US trade consultations. Sometimes they said a trade deal would be reached, and sometimes they said there might be some difficulties in reaching a deal, he added. "If you review China's remarks in the same period, you will find that our position has always been the same," Lu said, adding that China has always upheld the position that any difference between two countries, including China-US trade disagreements, should be resolved through friendly consultation and negotiation.
