The PwC survey showed that only 27 percent of global CEOs said the US would be one of their three top markets for growth, compared with 46 percent in 2018, the survey showed. However, the US remained an important market for most global CEOs followed by China, which saw a much smaller drop in its popularity - from 33 percent last year to 24 percent this year.More stability?The rise in Australia's popularity among Chinese CEOs didn't come without uncertainty. China-Australia relations have also at times seen turbulence, with the latter periodically - and some in China have said - criticizing China without justification on a wide range of issues.In a move that sent chills through Chinese technology companies last year, Australian officials heeded calls from their US counterparts in imposing a ban on Chinese telecom firm Huawei Technologies Co from supplying 5G equipment in the country. "If you look at the political and trade aspects, Australia is hardly an ideal choice. Politically, it falls in line with the US on many issues; trade-wise, the Australian market is just a fraction of that of the US," Zhao told the Global Times on Wednesday. "Australia is not a safe haven for Chinese companies given the rising anti-China sentiment there."Still, a bilateral trade agreement and some Australian local governments' welcoming attitude toward Chinese investments appear to be reassuring for some Chinese CEOs, Zhao noted. He said Chinese investment in Australian mining and agriculture is "generally welcomed" by local governments.While large Chinese deals in Australia have been facing tougher scrutiny, many Chinese investors continue to eye smaller businesses such as ranches and vineyards, according a Chinese student in Melbourne, who has been hired by "many Chinese businessmen" to help with everything from translation to booking hotels."Sometimes, there are so many that I have to find other students to help out," the student, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times. "There is a lot of negative news about Chinese investments and even us Chinese students, but so far everything is normal," the student said.
