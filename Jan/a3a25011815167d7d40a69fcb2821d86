Ted McKinney, an official at the US Department of Agriculture and a member of the US delegation to Beijing, was quoted by Reuters as saying, "I think they went just fine." He also suggested the outcome was "good" for the US, but did not elaborate, Reuters reported.Despite the lack of an official statement, major stock markets in Asia and Europe rallied on Wednesday, while US stock futures also extended their gains.In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite edged 0.71 percent higher on Wednesday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 2.3 percent. In South Korea, the KOSPI index jumped 1.8 percent, while the Nikkei 225 gained 1.1 percent. Major indexes in Europe rose in morning sessions, with the FTSE 100 up 1 percent before midday.Commodity prices also surged on Wednesday led by crude oil. The West Taxes Intermediate gained more than 2 percent to surpass $50 a barrel, while Brent Crude also rose 2 percent to above $60 a barrel.Global attention From the start, the trade negotiations had attracted global attention, as markets watched closely for every bit of news out of Beijing. And there were many distractions and surprises.On Monday, when the talks began, global attention turned toward an unannounced visit to Beijing by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The same day, the US sent a warship to the South China Sea, prompting China to dispatch its own vessels and aircraft to warn the US and lodge protests.Later on Monday, news broke that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who leads the Chinese negotiating team, made an unexpected appearance at the mid-level meeting. On Tuesday, officials decided to extend the negotiations to a third day."Overall, the whole process was very harmonious," Wei Jianguo, former Chinese vice minister of commerce, told the Global Times on Wednesday. "They were open about it and felt the need to extend the talks to get the job done."Media reports suggested that some deals might have been made, including China's purchase of US agricultural and energy products, and greater access for US firms to China's market."I think it is possible that the two sides agreed on some of these areas, because they are considered easy parts of the whole dispute," said Wang Jun, deputy director of the Department of Information at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. He told the Global Times on Wednesday that China had shown its willingness to import US soybeans and liquefied natural gas a long time ago, which are also important to the US, especially after the damage from the trade war.On Monday, Chinese companies bought at least three cargoes of US soybeans, totaling about 180,000 tons, while talks were underway in Beijing, Reuters reported."I think this round of talks focused on the easy parts. Both sides need to start with something," Wang said, noting that issues such as intellectual property rights and industrial policies will be addressed by higher-level officials.Liu, the vice premier, will reportedly travel to Washington for meetings with his US counterpart later this month, if things go well."But there are always risks and uncertainties," Wang said, referring to US President Donald Trump's threat that he would impose higher tariffs on Chinese goods if a deal is not reached by March.Newspaper headline: Positive note as talks end Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China's new flying saucer-like stealth drone seen in first public flightForeign diplomats discover a true Xinjiang, different from Western media reportsPLA trains super soldiers with futuristic weapons 2019 Rose Parade held in PasadenaThe tide is turning: racists, bigots and sexists finally being held accountableNo country can dominate Africa How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
