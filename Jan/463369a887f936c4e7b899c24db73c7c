It landed at the Kunlun Station Airport twice on January 8 and 17, 2017, Xinhua reported."The success of the third landing shows that China's expedition and its logistical support in Dome A are in a continuous and systematic state, and China's expedition capability in the Antarctic has reached a new level," Dong Yue, vice dean of School of Law of the Ocean University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday. Dong said the successful landing will help China establish a special protection zone in Dome A for the Antarctic's environment.Dong said China needs to further strengthen the construction of infrastructure in the Antarctic to increase the number of fixed-wing aircraft and airports in the region, and the related investment plan has been included in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020).Newspaper headline: Nation’s first fixed-wing plane lands on Antarctic peak Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Upgraded J-20 fighter jet 'overwhelmingly superior' to US F-35: analysts'Mediocrity of evil'China's 'Underground Steel Great Wall' capable of defeating hypersonic weapon attacks: academician 2019 Rose Parade held in PasadenaThe tide is turning: racists, bigots and sexists finally being held accountableNo country can dominate Africa How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
