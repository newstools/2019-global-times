Tibet's GDP was estimated at more than 140 billion yuan ($21 billion) last year. The 14th Dalai Lama fled abroad in 1959 with a small group of followers. His group is driven by the political goal of achieving "Tibetan independence." The official statistics of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council show that there are about 200,000 Tibetans living overseas, mainly in 40 countries such as India, Bhutan, the US and Switzerland, China National Radio reported in July 2014 Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Canada must not extradite Meng WanzhouFrance's reported block of Huawei is "almost a scandal"How to correctly read China's GDP figure 2019 Rose Parade held in PasadenaThe tide is turning: racists, bigots and sexists finally being held accountableNo country can dominate Africa How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
