The first draft of the law was submitted December 23, with the draft made available for public comment until February 24.Apart from protections in line with the first draft on foreign-invested companies' IPR and a ban on forced technology transfers, the new draft further expanded an article on the system of "pre-establishment national treatment" and the "negative list."The updated draft also said that the state shall not expropriate or requisition foreign investment, except under particular circumstances and in the public interest. The draft includes specific regulations regarding antitrust examination of mergers and acquisitions by foreign enterprises and penalties for failing to report their investment information to related authorities, Xinhua said. "The reforms advanced in the draft law are positive and, hopefully, an important indication of China's continuing desire to open up further," the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in China said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Wednesday."We appreciate the Chinese government's efforts to unify the legal framework for foreign investment administration, as well as its commitment to promote a predictable, transparent, and fair legal and regulatory regime for foreign investment in China,"  AmCham said.Rights and responsibilitiesChina has been widening market access for foreign investors, Dong Dengxin, director of the Financial Securities Institute at Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday. "The updated draft, which further removes barriers and clarifies regulations for foreign investment, shows the country's ambition to guarantee a favorable business investment for them," Dong said. He noted that the updated draft law for the first time highlights equal treatment for foreign and domestic firms, showing China's confidence in its economy.In June 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, unveiled a new version of the negative list that sets out sectors where foreign investment is limited or prohibited. The number of items on the negative list was cut to 48 from 63 in the previous version, which was released in June 2017.Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce's International Market Research Institute, said that the updated draft also listed specific regulations for foreign investors in China, telling them "if they want to operate in China, and enjoy the preferential policies we provide, they have to respect China's laws accordingly."For example, if under some extreme circumstances, such as natural disasters when the government has to expropriate or requisition foreign investment, they also have to provide corresponding cooperation, Bai said.Zhang Shizhan, general manager of an Israeli tech company based in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, said the new draft would of course be a boost for them to expand in China. He mentioned concerns over implementation of the law in the future. "Our concerns are mainly about the IPR part. We really hope the new law could fully ensure foreign tech companies' interests in that sector," Zhang said.Newspaper headline: NPC updates draft foreign investment legislation Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass J-16 fighter jet stealth-capable, able to carry all types of Chinese air-to-surface weaponsXi extends Spring Festival greetings to non-Communist parties, personagesForcing allies to pick sides, US destabilizes world order Chinese runner to finish pole-to-pole trekLA teachers strike shows failure of America's public school system2019 Rose Parade held in Pasadena How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
