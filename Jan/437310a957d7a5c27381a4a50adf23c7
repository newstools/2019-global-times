No one can give us an ultimatum," Maduro told CNN Turk in an interview dubbed into Turkish from Spanish.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been forging a stronger alliance with Maduro, and last month visited the embattled leader in Caracas.Maduro himself visited Turkey last year after Erdogan's victory in the national and presidential elections, hailing the Turkish president as a "friend" of Caracas.
