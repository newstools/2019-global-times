They also need to learn Putonghua.Muslim clerics should be the model of patriotism, law abiding, national unity and kindness, and should resist extreme ideas, promote harmony and lead religious believers to embrace national unity as much as their own eyes, and cherish national unity as much as their own lives, the statement said. Xinjiang is home to 24,400 mosques and about 29,000 Muslim clerics. Since 2001, the State Administration for Religious Affairs has held 12 training sessions for Muslim clerics, and has trained approximately 500 clerics for the region, according to a white paper issued by the State Council in 2016. "Muslim clerics generally refer to imams, who are respected by Muslims. Trained imams can help tens of thousands of believers nurture patriotism and national unity," Gao Zhanfu, a vice dean of the Beijing-based China Islamic Institute, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The China Islamic Association is about to compile textbooks for Muslim clerics around the country, which will further standardize their training. Professors who specialize in a certain subject are usually invited to train the clerics, Gao noted.The Central Institute of Socialism also frequently organized trainings for the clerics from Xinjiang, which covered five subjects - Putonghua, Chinese culture, Islam sinicization, de-extremism and a united Xinjiang of all ethnic minorities. Those sessions usually last four months, professors from the school told the Global Times on Wednesday.To strengthen the awareness of cultivating Muslim clerics, the China Islamic Association recently enacted a code of conduct for them during a meeting in Beijing. The news was published on the association's website on Monday."The code of conduct for Muslim clerics will standardize their behavior, which, in general, requires them to support the Party leadership and abide by China's laws," Jin Rubin, deputy chairman of the China Islamic Association, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Newspaper headline: Muslim clerics begin training Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China's new flying saucer-like stealth drone seen in first public flightForeign diplomats discover a true Xinjiang, different from Western media reportsPLA trains super soldiers with futuristic weapons 2019 Rose Parade held in PasadenaThe tide is turning: racists, bigots and sexists finally being held accountableNo country can dominate Africa How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
