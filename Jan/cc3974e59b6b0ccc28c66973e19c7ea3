Taking over from president Michel Temer, who has served the past two years, Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro called for a "true national pact" to free Brazil from corruption, crime and economic mismanagement as he was officially sworn in on Tuesday. But several uncertainties remain.The 63-year-old former paratrooper won a comfortable 55.2 percent of the vote in the presidential election over Fernando Haddad of the Workers' Party in October.Although during his presidential campaign, Bolsonaro was disgruntled over China, analysts believed the new Brazilian leader has changed his tune. Ji Bingxuan, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China attended Bolsonaro's inauguration ceremony in Brasilia on Tuesday.Turning right?Western media have called Bolsonaro the "Trump of the Tropics," comparing his ideas and social media presence with those of US President Donald Trump.The untested Brazilian leader has promised a crackdown on crime and corruption and vowed ideological opposition to the left wing, saying on Twitter that his education minister will put a stop to the ideology being taught in schools and universities - a swipe at the Workers' Party, which ruled Brazil from 2003 to 2016.But the country's ties with China are unlikely to change rapidly, said Zhou Zhiwei, executive director of the Brazil Research Center under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences."China and Brazil are complementary to each other in economy," Zhou told the Global Times on Tuesday, saying that "trade relations are unlikely to change rapidly, but the environment might become tightened."Both countries are emerging markets, and China is Brazil's major trading partner in bulk commodities, including soybeans and oil. The trade volume of soybeans between the two countries in 2018 was projected to reach a record-setting 80 million tons, according to Brazilian grain exporters association ANEC, thanks to the trade war between China and the US, which has led Beijing to shift to Brasilia.Dong Jingsheng, deputy director of Peking University's Latin America Research Center, said that though the US is cozying up to Brazil, with Trump sending Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the inauguration ceremony, Brazil is unlikely to change its policy toward China."The US has wooed populist Brazil to lean toward Washington, but that does not mean it will impair Brazil's relations with China," Dong said. "It is the economy that determines Brazil's relations with China."Roll backBolsonaro enjoys high popularity in Brazil, as the country has been hoping to bounce back from a recession since 2016."Brazilians are tired of the recession and want to change, and Bolsonaro has promised them something different from previous governments," Dong said."But it will no longer make cooperation with the third world [developing countries] its diplomatic priority like what the Workers' Party did … Brazil is looking westward now," Dong added.Bolsonaro's high-profile embrace of Israel has alarmed the country's big meat exporters, which fear losing their lucrative Arab markets, as Bolsonaro met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of the inauguration. Netanyahu said hours ahead of the ceremony that Bolsonaro had told him that the move was a matter of "when," not "if," but later it was hastily rowed by Bolsonaro saying "it was not decided yet." Bolsonaro may face some obstacles in governing, Dong said, as his Social Liberal Party scooped up 52 seats in the 513-member Congress, the second-biggest group in the fractured legislature. "To ensure his efficiency in governing, Bolsonaro will rely on deputies to lobby for his ideas to pass legislation," Dong said. Strict governmentBolsonaro's military background may lead to a strict government, Zhou said. Bolsonaro graduated from the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in Rio de Janeiro in 1977 and served as a paratrooper before becoming a politician. He is openly nostalgic for Brazil's 1964-85 military dictatorship and has formed a government with one-third of ministers who have military background."His military background may lead to a government that is not lenient as before," Zhou said, noting Bolsonaro has announced that he will pull Brazil out of a UN global pact on migration.Through a Facebook live broadcast last week, Bolsonaro reaffirmed that the country will leave the UN Global Compact for Migration, which was signed recently by 163 nations including Brazil. Another domestic issue for Bolsonaro is how to deal with Brazil's deteriorating environment, which includes the Amazon, often called the "lungs of the planet."Bolsonaro has indicated he will put mining and farming interests above conservation, as he said he is considering whether to keep Brazil in the Paris climate accord signed in 2015.Bolsonaro's pro-gun ideas have raised concerns, as he maintains that allowing "good" people to own guns will deter criminals - a measure opposed by 61 percent of Brazilians, according to a Datafolha survey.He expects the move could help bring down Brazil's record number of homicides, which reached nearly 64,000 last year. On Saturday, he tweeted that an imminent decree would make gun possession a lot easier for adults over 25 with no criminal record. "By decree, we intend to guarantee the possession of firearms for the citizen without criminal antecedents, as well as make its registration definitive," he said on Twitter.
