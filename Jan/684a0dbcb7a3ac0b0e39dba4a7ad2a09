She stepped down on Saturday after students expressed strong opposition against her email.Professor Don Taylor of the Academic Council, who oversees faculty conduct, has responded to the petition letter and committed to investigation, the drafting committee of the petition letter told the Global Times in an exclusive statement. Two of Neely's colleagues, whose names were not given, heard Chinese students speaking Chinese loudly in the study area, read the email.The two unnamed colleagues asked Neely to help them identify these students in case they had "interviewed for an internship or asked to work with them for a master's project."Neely wrote in the email, "To international students, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak in Chinese in the building."
