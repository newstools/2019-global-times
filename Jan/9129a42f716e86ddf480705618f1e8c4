Baidu's smart speaker Xiaoduzaijia is 349 yuan on its website dumall.baidu.com. Xiaomi's products cost between 269 and 599 yuan on the website mi.com."Factors such as operating systems, design and artificial intelligence technology will support HomePod's pricing," Xiao said.After Amazon first tapped the sector by unveiling its smart speaker Echo in 2014, China's JD.com Inc introduced the country's first homegrown smart speaker, Diongdong, in 2015.During the past three years, the domestic smart speaker sector saw a boost as many Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Xiaomi, Baidu and iFlytek Co poured into the market.Smart speaker shipments in China hit 5.8 million units in the third quarter of 2018, up 1 percent quarter-on-quarter, according to industry consultancy Canalys.Alibaba secured the first-place position in the third quarter, shipping 2.2 million Tmall Genie smart speakers, although this was down 26 percent on a quarterly basis. It was followed by Xiaomi and Baidu, with shipments of 1.9 million and 1.0 million units, respectively, Canalys figures showed.Apple is seeking a new growth driver in the form of smart home appliances to further expand in the Chinese market, according to Xiao. Apple lowered its revenue expectations on January 2 for the first time in 16 years due to poor iPhone sales.
