Karl Lagerfeld attends the Christmas Lights Launch On The Champs Elysees on November 22, 2018 in Paris. Photo: ICKarl Lagerfeld pulled out of two Chanel Paris haute couture fashion shows on Tuesday, with the label announcing the veteran designer "was tired this morning."As the French capital was hit by a snowstorm, the 85-year-old creator left his studio head Virginie Viard to take the bow for him at the end of his spring-summer collection.The no-show set off speculation that Lagerfeld, known as the "Kaiser" who has ruled over fashion for a large part of the past half century, may be about to step back.With fashionistas expecting the traditional theatrical reveal at the end of the show, with Lagerfeld appearing somewhere on the extravagant set, a Chanel executive emerged in his stead to announce the couturier's absence.He said Lagerfeld would be at a later, second show for super-rich clientele.But a Chanel spokeswoman later told AFP the designer was not able to attend that show either. The brand told Women's Wear Daily that "he was tired this morning."Helene Guillaume, a journalist with the French daily Le Figaro, said Lagerfeld was "very weak" at a pre-show briefing on Monday.Executives told AFP that Lagerfeld never made it as far as the Grand Palais where his collection was to be shown on a vast palm tree-fringed set styled after the gardens of an Italian villa."Mr Lagerfeld felt tired and asked Virginie Viard, the director of the creative studio to represent him," the brand confirmed in a statement."Virginie Viard and Eric Pfrunder, Chanel's director of image, will continue to work alongside him and follow up the collection and the brand's publicity campaigns," it added. At his last Paris show in October, Lagerfeld had gone out of his way to acknowledge Viard, one of the behind-the-scenes heroines at the luxury label, for her years of support.One veteran critic told AFP she could not remember Lagerfeld ever having missed a Chanel Paris show in four decades at the helm of the couture house.Lagerfeld himself said in 2015 that he "has never thought of retiring," and is understood to have carte blanche from Chanel's owners to choose when he wants to step down.The prolific German has left many younger creators in the dust, turning out collections season after season for Fendi and his own label, as well as Chanel.AFP Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Canada must not extradite Meng WanzhouFrance's reported block of Huawei is "almost a scandal"How to correctly read China's GDP figure 2019 Rose Parade held in PasadenaThe tide is turning: racists, bigots and sexists finally being held accountableNo country can dominate Africa How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
