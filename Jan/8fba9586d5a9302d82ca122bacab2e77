These features will help lower the network deployment costs. Although some Western countries, which are also allies of the US, have been blocking Huawei from participating in 5G construction and deployment for national security reasons, a large part of its commercial contracts have been secured in Europe. "These concrete business deals further demonstrate its capability of delivering sound and sustainable networks," Xiang Ligang, chief executive of telecom industry news site cctime.com, told the Global Times on Thursday. The company also launched its first 5G Modem named Balong 5000, which is claimed to the most powerful single-chip that supports different architectures.The US government has been putting increased pressure on its political allies, including the UK, Germany and Japan, to exclude China's Huawei from their 5G networks since 2018.
