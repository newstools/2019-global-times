China's Huawei Technologies said it is disappointed to learn of the criminal charges officially announced by the US Justice Department, and denied that it or its subsidiaries and affiliates have committed any of the asserted violations. "The company sought an opportunity to discuss the investigation by Eastern District of New York with the Justice Department, but the request was rejected without explanation," Huawei said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.  The statement also showed that it is not aware of any wrongdoing by its CFO Meng Wanzhou, and Huawei believes the US courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion. The US Justice Department on Monday US Time accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets, obstructing justice and bank fraud by evading economic sanctions on Iran. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker also confirmed at a press conference that the Justice Department is seeking the extradition of Meng from Canada. The US department also announced charges against Huawei for allegedly stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile. The charges stem from a civil trade secrets lawsuit filed by T-Mobile in 2014 over a robot called "Tappy," which was used in testing smartphones, CNBC reported.The local jury already determined that T-Mobile should be awarded $4.8 million in damages because Huawei had breached a handset supply contract with T-Mobile, but it did not award any damages from the trade secret claim, according to media reports.Huawei said the allegations from the Western District of Washington trade secret indictment case were already the subject of a civil suit that was settled by the parties after a Seattle jury found neither damages nor willful or malicious conduct on the trade secret claim.
