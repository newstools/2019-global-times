Photo: VCGChina's remote-sensing companies are expanding their domestic and foreign markets as they seek to seize opportunities that are emerging during the industry's commercialization.An executive of one remote-sensing data application company said its international strategy is closely in line with China's development strategy. The company is exploring markets involved in the Belt and Road initiative (BRI), especially in the areas of infrastructure construction and digitalization."As a public transportation system provider, our company will serve infrastructure construction in BRI economies by offering data and information analysis," Guo Panshi, deputy general manager of China Trans Geomatics Co, told the Global Times on Thursday.In the domestic market, the company will focus on making the best of its data and platform advantages to provide better industry solutions, Guo added.The number of remote-sensing downstream industry companies has increased dramatically in recent years. Further, services based on remote-sensing satellite data supply, processing and applications have been driven by China's vast market, strong advocacy from the scientific community and policy support, a report by Leading Industry Research showed in July.New growth points for the industry are emerging as China has made marked progress in associated technology and the nation's data application companies have broken international companies' monopolies, the report said.With several high-performance remote-sensing satellites, domestic remote-sensing satellite data has been recognized by users, and high-resolution satellite data in particular has increased from a market share of almost zero, the Science and Technology Daily reported on Wednesday.Xu Wen, director of the China Center for Resource Satellite Data and Applications, said that China's low- and medium-resolution data is basically self-sufficient. High-resolution data accounts for about 85 percent of the domestic market, and this segment of the industry has entered the EU market, as well as the markets of other developed countries and regions, according to Science and Technology Daily.NavInfo, a Beijing-based mapping provider, told the Global Times on Thursday that it has established branches in Europe, the US and Singapore to expand its regional businesses and carry out research cooperation in advanced technology areas with local institutions.However, the Leading Industry Research report noted that higher and more specialized demand for remote-sensing satellites has emerged, and continued technology and industry development requires further commercialization. Li Deren, a professor with Wuhan University, said it's important to enhance markets performance in further technology development, and social funds and private capital should be encouraged to invest in the remote-sensing industry.The timeliness, accuracy, high spectrum and high resolution of remote-sensing satellite services have generated new requirements for the development of the sector, Guo said.China's government policy covering private ownership of satellites has been liberalized, and that will allow companies to meet the market's need for more customized satellites, lower launch costs and better operational efficiency, Guo added.Newspaper headline: Remote-sensing firms seek more opportunities Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass Which country is set to lead on 5G development?100th Wing Loong armed reconnaissance drone to be delivered to international clientCanadian defendant to stand trial for drug smuggling in China No country can dominate AfricaChinese students in US overwhelmed by soaring tuition feesSearch Angels of Paradise How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
