Some of them might still tap into those businesses by working with an intermediary agent, a domestic company that holds those telecom licenses, which is not convenient for them," Xiang said. "BT has strengths in providing global telecommunication service, and its service could be favored by multinationals operating in China and Chinese companies conducting a global business," said Ma Jihua, an independent industry observer based in Beijing."And the business segment that serves companies yield higher margin for telecom operators and BT could potentially carve out a market share from the incumbent service providers including China's big three telecom operators and some smaller companies that provide the service," Ma told the Global Times Tuesday. "But the overall impact for now won't be too much."Xiang also noted that although BT does not have the capability to build a broadband network in China and has to cooperate with major domestic telecom giants, multinational company customers in China may value BT's reputation as a global telecom giant as well as some of its services.
