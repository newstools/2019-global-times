"For example, there should be a strict tracing and protection mechanism in African countries that produce ivory and rhino horns," Huo said.China's forestry departments are also trying to raise public awareness. The measures include the distribution of leaflets to passengers entering and leaving the country and showing infomercials on flights. They have likewise hired celebrities to urge the public not to smuggle ivory, rhino horns and other endangered species in public service announcements.Newspaper headline: Guangzhou customs seizes smuggled animal products Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Having funChinese company BYD announces 300th bus production in LancasterSan Diego says farewell to giant pandas
