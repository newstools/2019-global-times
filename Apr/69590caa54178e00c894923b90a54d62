US President Donald Trump pressed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to have Japanese automakers produce more vehicles in the US, according to a readout of their recent meeting provided by the US ambassador to Japan.The two discussed recent public announcements by Japanese car makers, including Toyota Motor Corp's decision to invest more in US plants."We talked about the need to see more movement in that direction but I think the president feels very positive that we will see such movement because all the economics support that," said Ambassador William Hagerty.Trump told a campaign rallyÂ  on Saturday that Abe said Japan would invest $40 billion in US car factories, though Trump did not give details on the timeline for the planned investments.Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, said it would exceed a 2017 pledge to invest $10 billion over five years with a new commitment to reach nearly $13 billion over that period.Trump has prodded Japanese automakers to add more jobs in the US as the White House threatens to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles, on the grounds of national security.He said it is possible that the US and Japan could reach a new bilateral trade deal by the time he visits Tokyo in May, but he and Abe cited areas where they differ on trade."We want to ensure that the US has trading terms with Japan that are no less favorable than any other nation," Hagerty said, adding that Trump is planning to attend the summit of G20 set to take place in Osaka, Japan in June.
