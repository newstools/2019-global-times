This group of people who are addicted to classical Chinese culture have been devoting themselves to studying ancient Chinese history.Despite the stereotype of gufeng music, Yin Lin defines gufeng music in a more inclusive way."All the songs that convey traditional Chinese culture can be defined as gufeng songs," she added. "Even if a song has a jazzy style, it can still be categorized as gufeng as long as the theme is to express traditional Chinese culture."Chic traditionThe number of gufeng enthusiasts has ballooned among China's younger generations with their interests in costumes and playlists.Instead of feeling awkward, wearing hanfu (traditional Han Chinese clothing) on a daily basis has become a normal lifestyle among China's younger generations."Those young girls wearing hanfu are walking in beauty," 32-year-old producer surnamed Liu said.According to Dong Rui, chairman of Bilibili, the number of users on Bilibili interested in gufeng has grown 20 times in the past five years since 2017.Several reality TV shows were produced to follow suit, such as Guofengmeishaonian [2019], which has become one of the top TV shows this year.Why gufeng is so popular among China's younger generations?Â From Yin Lin's perspective, millennial audiences have received relatively high-quality education on traditional Chinese culture, which provides them a qualified aesthetic to appreciate classical Chinese literature.However, it's not to say that people fond of gufeng music always bond with a single musical style.
