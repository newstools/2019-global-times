File photo: VCGChina is set to release an updated version of its personal credit report as part of the country's broader efforts in strengthening its social credit system. The report, which will cover almost every aspect of daily life, including overdue water and phone bills and spouse information, will become a "second ID and invisible resume" for citizens, analysts said.The Credit Reference Center, an independent credit information service institution under the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, has been developing a new version of the personal credit report, which is likely to be officially launched in the near future, the Economic Daily reported over the weekend.To help improve the Chinese credit system, the new report will feature more "detailed, comprehensive and precise credit dimensions," the Economic Daily said, citing He Nanye, a research fellow with the Suning Institute of Finance.In addition to some basic personal information that was required by the old credit report, the new version will include more details such as spouse information and more complete professional information, He said. Individual financial activities such as repayment and overdue payments will be recorded in the new report, which will also focus on information including telecommunications, water supply payment, overdue taxes, civil rulings, administrative punishment, subsistence allowance, professional qualifications and administrative incentives, according to the news report.The information included in the new credit report covers various aspects of people's lives and any discredited behaviors will be recorded, leading to restrictions in their daily activities. For example, credit approval from financial institutions can be affected for a person with negative records on their credit report. Industry insiders said that as the new report includes the information of spouses, if a couple gets divorced in order to take advantage of favorable policies for first home buyers, such as lower down payment and interest rates, they will no longer be eligible for the policies.Credit records do not merely focus on borrowing money. Other aspects such as overdue water and phone bills, which "are not trivial things," are also important factors that can help create a more multi-dimensional evaluation of an individual's social credit, Dong Zheng, an industry analyst in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday."Credit is a person's second ID card. It is a business card and an invisible resume," Dong Ximiao, senior researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday.The report released by the PBC organ will focus heavily on personal information security and privacy protection, Dong Ximiao said. For example, the EU has strict rules on the protection of personal information and privacy, and violators will be seriously punished, according to Dong Ximiao. China is expected to step up lawmaking and carry out better protection, he said.China's personal credit system was developed relatively late compared to Western countries, and it is not widely used and not yet mature, lacking a strong binding impact on people's credit, a Beijing-based industry insider surnamed Chen told the Global Times on Sunday. "Most Chinese people have had weak awareness about building personal credit in previous years, and the new credit report is expected to become a reminder for them to learn about the importance of social credit," Chen said."To gain a higher social credit score, we must behave well," a local resident in Beijing surnamed Long told the Global Times. "As it will affect almost every aspect of our lives, people will find it difficult to buy an apartment and a car or marry someone if they have low scores."China has strengthened efforts to regulate discredited behavior during recent years.The government of East China's Zhejiang Province plans to employ social credit to regulate people who frequently and maliciously resign and then apply for jobs, and relevant measures are under discussion, the Nanfang Metropolis Daily reported, citing a local official.Newspaper headline: Social credit to become ‘second ID, invisible resume’ for Chinese: analysts China to be offered Russia's 'best warplane' Su-57New Zealand Prime Minister visits ChinaIndia's nationalistic media could disrupt China-India ties Seeing the futureAllahu Akbar
