Young truck drivers from Nepal take a stroll in Gyirong, a town of China's Tibetan Autonomous Region bordering with Nepal on March 17. The rapid development in Tibet has attracted more people from Nepal to the Gyirong town, where they can earn more compared to their hometowns.

Before earthquakes hit Nepal in April 2015, more than 90 percent of goods going in or out of Tibet were shipped through Zhangmu, Cidannuobu, an official with Lhasa customs, told the Global Times.Zhangmu Port was closed after the earthquakes and Gyirong port, which is about 300 kilometers away, now handles 99.7 percent of the trade with Nepal, the official said. Trade volume through Gyirong Port has still not reached the level processed by Zhangmu Port before the earthquakes.Cidannuobu said that the business environment of Zhangmu Port and the business conditions along the Araniko Highway, which links the Zhangmu-Kodari crossing with Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, are now mature and can't be matched by other ports in Tibet.More than 70 percent of Nepalis live along the route from Zhangmu to Kathmandu, and this commercial line is important to Nepal, Cidannuobu said. After the closure of the Zhangmu Port, the Nepali side repeatedly expressed the wish that the border port could resume operating as soon as possible.Nepali Ambassador to China Leela Mani Paudyal said that Nepal has acquired many resources, as well as expertise and opportunities for human resources development, through the BRI and wants to further expand cooperation with China in a variety of businesses, the Xinhua News Agency reported in March.Cidannuobu said local customs have strengthened efforts to promote the reopening of Zhangmu Port since the end of 2017 and carried out preparations for the resumption of cargo movements.The priority is to resume cargo clearance. As the local infrastructure continues to improve during the next year or two, trade volume is expected to see a boost, he said.
