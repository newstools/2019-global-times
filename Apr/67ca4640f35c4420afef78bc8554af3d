Xu Weining Photo: ICTaiwan actress Xu Weining apologized on Thursday after she liked tweets suspected of supporting Taiwan secession on Instagram, which received different reactions on social media.Xu, a mixed-blood of Chinese, American and Italian, recently liked a tweet of a photo of  a Japanese view, and caption containing content regarding Taiwan as an independent country on Instagram, which was slammed by Chinese mainland netizens.Xu posted an apology and explanation on Sina Weibo on Thursday."I just found myself making a stupid mistake… I just liked the tweet habitually without paying attention to the caption…My ancestral home is Wuhu in (East China's) Anhui Province…Residents across strait are family…" wrote Xu, promising she would be more careful about her words and acts.Xu soon closed her account on Instagram claiming it was for introspection. Xu's office also published an apology letter handwritten by Xu.Some netizens joyfully accepted her apology. "Her apology is sincere, her explanation is clear and reasonable," wrote a netizen on Sina Weibo, also calling other netizens not to be overly nationalistic and critical.Some Taiwan people said Xu's statement did not clear her political stand of the One-China principle. "Many Taiwan people are originally from the Chinese mainland. And we are exactly all China descendants," commented a Taiwan netizen on Instagram. "It's a typical case of double-dealing," a Beijing-based employee in the entertainment industry, who asked for anonymity, told the Global Times, claiming that she made similar multiple mistakes on Instagram.The apology is more like surrendering to public pressure rather than someone showing true repentance, she said.
