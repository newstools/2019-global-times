Myers, president/CEO, San Diego Zoo Global."The panda program we began together demonstrates how powerful these collaborative efforts can be. We are extremely grateful to China for sharing the pandas with us and offering us the chance to serve this species in a leadership role."

Bai Yun, Gao Gao and Bai Yun's cubs, including her sixth cub Xiao Liwu, helped scientists learn a great deal about panda behavior, pregnancy, births, and maternal and geriatric care. This knowledge has enabled them to provide necessary help to boost giant pandas' wild population in China to more than 2,000. "Although we are sad to see these pandas go, we have great hopes for the future," said Shawn Dixon, chief operating officer, San Diego Zoo Global. "Working with our colleagues in China, San Diego Zoo Global is ready to make a commitment for the next stage of our panda program."Zoo guests can continue to visit Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu at their home in Panda Canyon until April 27. Details of the panda celebration that will occur for a couple of weeks in April will be shared as they are developed.
