As China has been ramping up efforts to push forward financial opening-up, overseas investors have also responded actively by further expanding their foothold in the country.The latest sign has come in the country's bond market, as according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System & National Interbank Funding Center, foreign institutions are moving into China's bond market at the fastest speed since 2019, with products from leading global asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard entering the market at a large scale.In the first quarter of 2019, transactions by foreign institutional investors in the Chinese market reached 919.1 billion yuan ($136.77 billion), up 31 percent year-on-year, according to data from the Center.Analysts believe the trend will accelerate, as starting Monday, 364 Chinese yuan-denominated bonds will be added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index over the next 20 months."The inclusion marks a milestone for China's financial opening-up efforts, as it shows international investors' recognition of China's bond market, which will in turn attract more overseas investors to the country's rapidly expanding bond market," Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Dong Dengxin, director of the Financial Securities Institute at Wuhan University of Science and Technology, agreed, saying that "opening-up of the bond market means more liquidity in the domestic market and further penetration into the global financial system, and it will also increase the internalization of yuan." According to a Bloomberg report, full inclusion will increase China's weight in the index to around 6 percent, and Chinese bonds will become the fourth-largest currency component, following the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen. Experts noted that opening-up of the country's bond market, estimated to be worth $13 trillion, also has advantages over those in the US or other overseas markets - lower risks and higher returns. This makes it more attractive and will benefit the long-term growth of the global capital market.China has unveiled a series of financial opening-up measures, including reducing the ownership limits on overseas financial capital and lifting the quotas on stock link programs between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. China has vowed to encourage foreign investors to enter its trust, financial leasing, auto finance, money brokerage and consumer finance sectors, Xinhua reported.Last year, Chinese A shares were included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.While Xi noted that despite progressing at a fast pace in recent years, China's opening-up in the financial sector is still at a preliminary level, and the government will continue to roll out measures to ease restrictions and allow more foreign investors to participate in financial products such as commodity futures in the year ahead."In a bid to attract and keep foreign investors, China will also need to strengthen regulation and further reduce administrative interventions in the financial markets to pave the way for more global index inclusions and a further integration into the global financial system," Dong said.
