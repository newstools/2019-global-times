Photo: AFP A woman in Southwest China, who must have had job-interview-jitters, was surprised and delighted when she was required to play Mahjong during an interview for a sales manager position. Company managers in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, said they can quickly learn a lot about a person's moral characters, strategic thinking, how they handle pressure and even the way they talk during a game of Mahjong, btime.com reported on Monday."I know Chengdu residents love playing Mahjong but didn't expect I would be asked to play it during a job interview. Plus, I won," said the woman. The video didn't report if she got the job. The job description required someone who is smart, honest, can perform under pressure and get along well with customers.The company's unorthodox hiring practices got a lot of positive feedback on social media. "Hahaha, this is typical Chengdu," wrote a netizen. Some people wondered if they would let the managers win."I don't know how to play Mahjong, so I wouldn't stand a chance to pass this interview," was another typical comment. Playing Mahjong  as part of a job interview seems to have started in Japan. Btime.com Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Modern-day matchmakerCandlelight vigilWestern media creates illusion for human trafficking victims
