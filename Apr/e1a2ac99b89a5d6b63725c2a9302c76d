The move was hailed by the Chinese foreign ministry as a "new paradigm" for international cooperation in retrieving lost cultural relics. Many officials from cultural heritage departments of Central and Eastern Europe countries attended this forum. They expressed strong willingness to cooperate with China on recovering and preserving relics. China and the Czech Republic conducted many exchanges on preserving cultural relics and the two sides have huge potential for cooperation, archeological excavations and the restoration of relics, Jiri Vajcner, head of Monument Preservation Department of the Ministry of Culture of Czech Republic, told the Global Times. Previously, China lagged behind Western countries regarding excavation and preservation of its cultural relics and "sometimes we have to rely on countries such as France, the US and Japan to help us protect our relics," said Chai.Nowadays, China is a leader in the field and often provides support for developed and neighboring countries. "China now has the world's best conditions for preserving objects of cultural heritage and the strongest government support on this matter," said Chai.According to Liu, China has cooperated or is working with 24 countries and regions, covering Europe, South America, Africa and Asia, on heritage protection and restoration.Immediately after the devastating 8.1-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal in 2015, China dispatched experts to participate in post-quake investigations and assessment of damaged cultural heritage properties. The projects include restoration of the Dharahara (Bhimsen Tower) in Kathmandu.In order to better protect the world's heritage, China is willing to join hands with other countries to enhance cooperation in fields such as museum management, joint archeology, developing hi-tech processes to preserve excavated relics, and training of professionals, Hu Bing, deputy head of SACH, said on this forum.
