I believe that China and Italy have set an example for the repatriation of cultural relics to the world," Markus Wyss, a visitor from Switzerland, told the Global Times."Italy and China are cultural superpowers, and the two countries have the highest number of UNESCO heritage sites. We are looking forward to celebrating the year of culture and tourism in 2020," Italian Ambassador to China Ettore Francesco Sequi told the Global Times."The US has returned another 391 cultural relics, and these have already arrived in China. We are planning to hold a joint exhibition of repatriated cultural relics in the future," Guan Qiang, deputy director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, told the Global Times.It is difficult to copy the success of the Italian case because each instance of looted cultural relics was caused by a different reason, Guan said.Under the framework of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, China and Italy will launch collaborative programs between the administrative bodies of World Heritage Sites, with the aim of enhancing exchanges in good practice, protection, promotion and management strategies, and developing new models for cross-border protection, according to China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism.It said that joint training mechanism for professionals from museums and heritage institutions will be established, with the aim of promoting exchanges and research in conservation theories.Newspaper headline: More than 700 cultural relics returned by Italy go on show in Beijing Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Having funChinese company BYD announces 300th bus production in LancasterSan Diego says farewell to giant pandas
