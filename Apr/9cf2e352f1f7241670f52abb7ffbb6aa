China and the US continue their trade negotiations in Washington aiming to reach an agreement that will soon end the yearlong trade deadlock, as officials on Friday hailed major progress in recent talks but alluded that more work needs to be done.Though the two sides appear inching closer to a much-anticipated trade deal, there remains several key sticking points, including the tariffs which are already in place and an enforcement mechanism, on which Chinese officials are expected to hold a firm position, analysts said.At a meeting between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday, US time, officials from both sides sounded optimistic about the ongoing talks, though they also maintained a fine line in discussing a specific deadline for a deal.In the meeting, Liu, who is leading the Chinese delegation to Washington, told Trump that the two teams had "productive" consultations in the past two days and that "new consensuses" had been reached over important issues such as the text of the potential trade deal, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Trump also said that the two countries are close to what he described will be an "epic" deal and suggested that officials are aiming to reach a deal within the next four weeks, according to US media outlets.In a message to Trump, conveyed by Liu at the meeting, President Xi Jinping called for "the two sides to keep up with the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and resolve issues of mutual concern so as to conclude the negotiations on the agreement text as soon as possible," Xinhua reported.Chinese and US officials held talks on Wednesday and Thursday in Washington, where they apparently focused on the text of the potential trade agreement, the tariffs they have imposed on goods worth billions of dollars, a verification mechanism and other related issues. As per reports further talks are slated to continue on Friday."From what I've been hearing is that the two sides are very close to a deal," a source in Washington who maintains close contact with the trade officials told the Global Times on Friday, "I think the agreement itself is nearing completion. They are now focusing on the enforcement issues."However, even as they hailed the progress, US officials stopped short of announcing a final trade deal and a date for a summit between Xi and Trump to sign the deal, as initially they were reported to do at the meeting with Liu on Thursday.Â "This is within expectation," Huo Jianguo, vice chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times on Friday. He said that China has been very firmly asserting that the US must lift tariffs on Chinese goods and that an enforcement mechanism must be a two-way street. "These are issues Chinese officials are unlikely to back off."US officials have shown some compromise in recent weeks as they were reportedly considering lifting some tariffs, but Chinese officials are pushing for all the tariffs to be removed."For the Chinese side, the US should immediately remove tariffs on the $250 billion worth of Chinese products after signing a deal," said Liang Haiming, dean of Hainan University Belt and Road Research Institute who follows the trade talks closely, "If the tariffs were not to be removed, it is highly unlikely that China and the US will reach a deal in the short term."Citing a slew of recent positive developments in the Chinese market, including unexpectedly upbeat data on the country's manufacturing and service sectors and a bullish stock market, analysts said that Chinese officials are well positioned to hold their firm position on the tariff and other remaining issues."The time is on the China's side. The US is in a hurry, but China isn't," Liang said, pointing to rising domestic pressure on the US administration, worsening economic conditions and political optics for Trump to reach a deal in a heated presidential election campaign season.In stark contrast to US officials, who have frequently given out deadlines on talks and plans for a summit meeting, Chinese officials have been more cautious about speaking specifics of the deadline or the summit."For China, all details are needed to be ironed out before setting up a summit meeting to avoid any risks of failure at the meeting," Huo said.
