Alphabet Inc's Waymo said on Tuesday it had chosen a factory in Detroit to mass produce self-driving cars, looking to the historical heart of the auto industry to build the vehicles of the future.Chief Executive John Krafcik said in a blog post that Waymo would work with American Axle & Manufacturing to lease and repurpose an existing Detroit facility that will be operational by mid-2019.Waymo said in January it had chosen the US state of Michigan for its first production facility, adding it would receive incentives from the public-private partnership agency, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, and create up to 400 jobs over time exclusively related to self-driving.In a sea of rivals, Waymo is thought of as being ahead in the self-driving race. It already operates a robotaxi service in the state of Arizona that it plans to expand geographically over time.Global automakers, large technology companies and start-ups are all engaged in self-driving efforts, but experts expect it will be years before systems are ready to be rolled out in all areas, with software and regulations among the many challenges.Waymo is competing with rivals General Motors (GM) and Uber Technologies to deploy such vehicles for the masses. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also announced the company plans to launch a robotaxi service in 2020.Waymo, which has been working on self-driving technology for a decade, provided few new details.It currently retrofits Chrysler Pacifica minivans to use in its robotaxi fleet.In March 2018, Waymo said it would diversify the fleet, working with Jaguar to produce up to 20,000 vehicles by 2022, able to conduct about 1 million trips per day.American Axle, Waymo's partner for its Detroit facility, was formed in 1994 when an investment team purchased five plants that GM had put up for sale.GM plans to end output at its last Detroit factory next year, after announcing in November a plan to halt production at five North American assembly plants and cut about 15,000 jobs.Fiat Chrysler said in February it would invest $4.5 billion in five plants and create 6,500 jobs in Michigan.In January, Waymo said it planned to hire engineers, operations experts, fleet coordinators and others to retrofit vehicles with its self-driving technology.Both GM and Ford Motor Co have said they will build autonomous vehicles at Michigan factories.
