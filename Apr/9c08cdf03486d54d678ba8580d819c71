(Xinhua/Mao Siqian) For those naysayers who constantly peddle that China is losing appeal to foreign investors amid trade disputes, it is time to face the truth that China remains a top magnet for foreign companies."There is little evidence of a systemic spike in the number of firms shifting production away from China in the wake of the trade dispute," Herald van der Linde, HSBC Global Research's head of equity strategy in the Asia-Pacific wrote in a study released in the South China Morning Post.It is true that some companies have announced that they are looking to set up export manufacturing capacity elsewhere worrying about the potential impact of raised US import tariffs, but for most, the advantages of "Made in China" still outweigh the risks, he wrote.Indeed, with a globally competitive supply chain eco-system, growing consumption power driven by the ever-expanding middle-income group and optimized domestic business environment, China will continue to appeal to investors worldwide.
