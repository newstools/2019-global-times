As cities expand, governments are reforming the system to lower the threshold of eligibility for hukou.However, analysts said an overemphasis on the housing market amounts to a wrong interpretation on the new policy as jobs and a timely improvement of city functions are the main themes of China's urbanization drive, which allowed 14 million rural migrant workers to obtain hukou in 2018.Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Thursday that relaxing hukou requirements in 2019 will raise the question of how cities can beef up their vocational training capacity to enlarge their talent pools."Cities are expected to receive a large influx of rural migrant workers due to the new policy. Localities should strengthen their vocational training institutions to arm this 'new blood' with skills that match their unique environments and strengths," Cong said.Such a capacity-building exercise will decide the future of these cities, as cities across China vie for talent with special perks and the nation's economy transforms into one that relies more on services and consumption, experts said.The vocational training issue cannot be over exaggerated as an April 2018 report showed that the percentage of rural migrant workers who have received agricultural or non-agricultural trainings in 2017 has actually decreased 0.1 percentage point over that of 2016.Localities periodically run into labor shortages and some cities are experiencing net population outflows, according to media reports.Li Chang'an, a professor at the Department of Public Economics at the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Thursday that the government invested heavily in equipping rural labors with the skills to get work in the cities. "Many such policies are encouraging in nature and the corporate sector is also doing its part," Li said.China will allocate 100 billion yuan ($14.89 billion) from its unemployment insurance account to conduct 15 million vocational training or retraining courses in 2019, according to the Government Work Report in March. "Besides skills, such training is also set to include workers' rights education, as infringement has had a negative impact on labor market development," Li said.Experts warned that there are weak links. Li said the cost of "turning" a migrant rural worker into a city resident with a hukou will be about 130,000 yuan in terms of infrastructure, housing, medical care and schools.As urban residents also earn as much as three times as rural ones, income inequality will also be tackled during the process of further urbanization, Li said.Life-changing processFor millions of Chinese people from rural areas, urbanization is a life-changing event they are experiencing firsthand. The changes are taking place in areas ranging from where they derive their values to the outlook for their children.A 20-something migrant worker surnamed Jia works in one of the industrial parks outside Zhengzhou, capital of Central China's Henan Province. He came from a rural area of nearby Anyang. Zhengzhou has been an emerging manufacturing hub in Central China. Most of the world's iPhones are produced in its industrial complexes. "Back home, I find it quite hard to land something I can get money out of. Here, there are busy seasons and slack seasons, but jobs are always there," Jia told the Global Times on Thursday. A housekeeper surnamed Wang works with two Beijing families to help them cook and tidy up their homes.Wang easily earns about 5,000 yuan per month, an income hardly imaginable in her hometown in a rural area of East China's Jiangxi Province."I'm not fully literate, but both of my boys are college graduates and they have settled in Shanghai," Wang told the Global Times.Newspaper headline: Jobs, not property, are key to urbanization Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Chinese company BYD announces 300th bus production in LancasterSan Diego says farewell to giant pandasSeeing the future
