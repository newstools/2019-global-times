A total of 18 ports will have such special passages. For foreign crew members who carry out maritime BRI transport missions, if they need to apply for a stay permit to leave the port cities by transferring to different means of transportation, the time for the document issuance will be reduced from seven days to three days. Those who have urgent requirements can obtain the document on the day of acceptance, Qu said.Jia Tongbin, an official with the State Immigration Administration's department in charge of managing foreigners, revealed that nearly 80 percent of international trade comes through maritime transport, and Chinese ports made up nine out of the top ten busiest ports in 2018.Newspaper headline: Special passages set up to fast track exit-entry procedures for BRI-related people Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Delegation of HUST attends alumni gala in Los AngelesChinese driving Vegas growthHaving fun
