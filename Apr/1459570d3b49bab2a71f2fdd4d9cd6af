The promotion of "model" or exemplary stores whose owners or employees are members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has not only improved sales, but attracted more people to participate in Party-building activities. In the Hengshan Road business district in Yantai, East China's Shandong Province, there are 12 CPC member-owned stores, He Xiaolong, an official of the Hengshan CPC committee, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The stores sell a variety of goods."We started to award model CPC member store status to encourage more people to participate in Party-building activities," He said. A local store can apply to be designated a "model" store if its owner or at least one of its employees is a CPC member. He said they have very strict criteria for selecting these exemplary stores, including going through tax records, complaint records and surveying how satisfied local residents are with it. Local customers say they trust these model stores more than normal stores. A customer who asked for anonymity told the Global Times that "model shop owners are usually warm and thoughtful, so I don't need to worry about being cheated."One local shop owner said that the popularity of CPC member model stores is putting pressure on non-CPC member owners. "I'm applying to join the Party to get this model status as soon as possible."Shandong is not the only place that has been promoting CPC member-owned stores.These stores attract more customers, said Gan Yonghong from the CPC committee in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province.
