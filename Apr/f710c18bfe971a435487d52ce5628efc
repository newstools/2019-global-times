E Fund Management Co, China Asset Management, Hua An Fund Management Co and China Southern Asset Management Co have reportedly applied to invest in Japanese ETFs, and their applications were accepted on April 12.The agreement marks further deepening of cooperation between the two capital markets, said CSRC Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai, a statement on the CSRC's website showed. China and Japan have huge cooperation potential in stock markets, Fang said."Japan has more long-term funds that need to invest in China's high-yield capital market, while China has more deposits that need to invest in stable markets in Japan," Fang said.The cooperation will benefit stock markets in both countries, especially for blue chips in China's market, Li Daxiao, chief economist at Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities, told the Global Times on Monday.China needs to learn from Japan capital market's role in supporting innovative and technology industries, officials said, as the traditional Chinese method of borrowing from banks is not applicable to new industries.  Japan has already established a multi-dimensional capital market, which includes exchange groups, local exchanges and a Green Sheet Market, said Fang.The Tokyo Stock Exchange has set up a sector for emerging technology and innovative enterprises. This part of the market has more relaxed requirements for profits, allowing companies that haven't yet started to make a profit to list, and it has higher requirements on information disclosure, Fang said.
