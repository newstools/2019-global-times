China and the EU firmly support the rules-based multilateral trading system and commit to complying with WTO rules, said the joint statement.The statement demonstrates both sides' determination to unite and cooperate at a time that multilateralism is challenged, and the significance of the statement has gone beyond a bilateral scope, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said at a daily briefing on Wednesday. It is normal that countries have disputes and it's normal that China and Europe have disagreements. The statement shows that disputes between China and Europe can be properly addressed via negotiations and dialogue, Lu said. The achievement demonstrates the high level of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU, Lu said.It is understandable that European countries may have concerns about a partner's capacity to fulfill promises and deliver concrete results, especially after they saw US President Donald Trump's backtrack many times, said Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.However, China's efforts to fulfill promises and address partners' concerns are acknowledged by more and more countries, and that's why so many fruitful results were yielded so soon this time, she said. In the statement, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to building an economic relationship based on openness, non-discrimination and fair competition, ensuring a level playing field, transparency and based on mutual benefits.The two sides also set a timetable to achieve "decisive progress" on an investment pact and to finalize a "high-level" pact in 2020. Both sides agree that there should not be forced transfers of technology, read the statement.Chen noted that it is not easy for both sides to issue a statement that covers these hard-core and thorny issues.It shows how much China and Europe are willing to meet each other halfway to address issues of mutual concern and how they are willing to cooperate to tackle  common challenges, Chen said. According to official statistics, the EU has been China's top trading partner for 15 years in a row, while China has been the EU's second-largest trading partner for several years running. Two-way trade hit a new record of $682.16 billion in 2018.Zhang Shengjun, an international politics professor at Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times that as China and the US are in the final stages of reaching a deal over the trade spat, Europe is worried that the deal might give the US more advantages in trade and business with China, so it is also eager to at least reach some consensus on similar issues.The statement could help reassure European countries that China is not giving the US preferential treatment on issues that Europe also cares about, Chen said.Mutual goalsLi arrived in Zagreb on Tuesday evening to pay an official visit to Croatia, where he will also attend the eighth leaders' meeting of China and Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC).Premier Li is the first Chinese premier to visit Croatia since the two countries established diplomatic ties 27 years ago. Describing the 16+1 cooperation as a mechanism well-positioned to serve as an important platform for synergizing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the EU Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia, the premier said in a Tuesday article that interested countries are welcome to participate in third-party cooperation projects under the 16+1 framework in a substantive way through concrete projects.The positive momentum, however, did raise concerns, especially from traditional major powers in Europe, including core EU members like France and Germany, on whether Europe is becoming more divided because of China. It's never been about forming a clique against the US or any other country, nor should the cooperation be perceived as a so-called "divide and rule" approach, Chinese analysts said. "It's natural that China and some European countries are standing closer as they face the same challenges. Now they are more and more on the same page on how to promote development and reform," Chen said."Instead of taking China as a competitor, it would be more practical for Europe to perceive China as a cooperator in terms of economic opportunities," Zhang said. "They could both be winners as they are highly complementary in many aspects," he said. Xinhua contributed to this story Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Seeing the futureAllahu Akbar
