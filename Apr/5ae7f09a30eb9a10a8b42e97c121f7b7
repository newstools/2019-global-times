A post of Di Ba group Photo: Sina WeiboA group of patriotic Chinese netizens flooded the Facebook pages of East Turkestan terrorists  with pictures and stickers on Wednesday night, a move they said aims to fight against Western lies about Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Starting at 8 pm on Wednesday, net users posted pictures of people's life in Xinjiang, China's policies on Xinjiang as well as memes under posts of two East Turkestan terrorists' Facebook pages. One post received over 1,000 comments within 20 minutes.The Di Ba group on Baidu Tieba, one of China's largest online forums, announced a "war" against the East Turkestan terrorist groups in a notice published on its Facebook account on Tuesday. The notice said terrorists and separatists planned attacks that claimed hundreds of civilians' lives, including the Xinjiang 7/5 riot in 2009 and the terrorist attack on Kunming railway station in 2014, and fabricated rumors about so-called "concentration camps" in Xinjiang, and they simply do not want Xinjiang residents to live a happy life. Yin Yuancheng, one of the organizers of the event and a building material dealer, told the Global Times on Wednesday that "we have created meme pictures that mock biased and fabricated reports about Xinjiang and we've also prepared some memes in the Uyghur language.""There are 2,000 members in our team and after the notice was published, another 3,000 applied to join in our action," Yin said.When a Global Times reporter joined one of the groups, a reminder was given that the move is targeted at separatists and extremists and "all participants must mind their words and manners."Analysts believe that the online event shows how ordinary Chinese net users perceive Xinjiang affairs and the government's policy in Xinjiang.Their campaign aims to condemn East Turkestan terrorists and separatists' lies and distortion about Xinjiang, Yin said. "We want to tell people the truth that the region is stable and prosperous."  The "crusade" has organized several fights. In 2016, the group bombarded the Facebook pages of then Taiwan leader-elect Tsai Ing-wen with comments and stickers calling the island of Taiwan an inalienable part of China. There were also calls for the online group to be rational to show their emotions and properly channel their passion in their previous campaigns.Newspaper headline: Patriotic posts flood East Turkestan pages Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Seeing the futureAllahu Akbar
