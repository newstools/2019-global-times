I also ask parents to help if these measures fail to  work," Zhang said, noting that she would be afraid of parents coming to the school to cause her trouble if she physically punished the students.Many netizens said that punishment is acceptable and necessary for students as long as it is not out of proportion."Children don't have a developed level of self control. Particularly with the popularity of the internet, it is more and more difficult to ask students to pay full attention in class. Punishment to a certain degree can build up teacher's prestige and establish a better teacher-student relationship," Qin An, head of Institute of China Cyberspace Strategy, told the Global Times on Sunday.Guangdong provincial justice department told The Beijing News on Thursday that they had not approved the draft yet and would continue to solicit opinions.
