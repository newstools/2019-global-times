The method can increase the added value of raw materials by eight to 10 times," Xu told the Global Times.This method has many advantages, including high gain of ethylene, low energy consumption, less processing, and lower costs compared with traditional processes like liquefied gas and naphtha, according to Xu.Polyethylene products have been in short supply in China for a long time, especially high-density polyethylene products which have strong profitability.The project aims to produce 600,000 tons of ethylene per year, with projected annual output value of 6 billion yuan and 1.029 billion yuan in annual profits."The project will provide an additional 10,000 job opportunities and inject new impetus into the transformation and upgrading of high-tech development in southern Xinjiang's petrochemical industry," Li Luguang, the vice president of PetroChina, a listed arm of CNPC, told the Global Times.The Tarim Oilfield, whose natural gas production accounts for one-sixth of total domestic production, is rich in natural gas resources and is the third-largest oil and gas field in China, according to a document CNPC sent to the Global Times. CNPC plans to invest more than 150 billion yuan in Xinjiang to promote the steady growth of oil and gas production equivalents of more than 50 million tons. It will build Xinjiang into an important oil and gas production base in China and China's largest oil and gas import channel on land, according to Xu.
