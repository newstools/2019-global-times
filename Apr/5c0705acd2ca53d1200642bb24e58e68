"China is only supporting Indonesia's economy, not intervening in the country's domestic affairs."Widodo, who narrowly defeated Subianto by a 6.3 percent margin in the previous presidential election in 2014, has put his focus on further strengthening the economy across the sprawling archipelago of more than 17,000 islands.Indonesia, a G20 country, has had a stable GDP annual growth of around 5 percent since 2014, although it is still short of Widodo's 2014 election pledge to hit 7 percent annually.Subianto is currently trailing Widodo by double digits in most domestic polls. The election is considered a huge logistical operation, with 245,000 candidates vying for votes in what is described as the world's biggest single-day election. Aiming to boost domestic power, Indonesia signed a total of $23 billion worth of contracts with China last year, including two hydropower plants in Kalimantan, Borneo, and a power station on tourism hotspot Bali."Indonesia needs to improve its infrastructure if it wants to speed up its economic development," Gu told the Global Times. "China is the top trade partner of Indonesia, which means there is mutual trust between the two countries."More cooperation projects between China and Indonesia are already in talks, media reports suggest, and are likely to be finalized at the Belt and Road Forum later this month."The Belt and Road Initiative is benefitting Indonesia, which needs improvements to its infrastructure," Gu said. "China's experienced skills in infrastructure will further improve Indonesia's economy."The General Election Commission of Indonesia is expected to announce the official result in May.Newspaper headline: China a focus at Indonesian elections Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Chinese company BYD announces 300th bus production in LancasterSan Diego says farewell to giant pandasSeeing the future
