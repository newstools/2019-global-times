They also equipped some workers in Gulou district with the watch last year, according to the staff, thepaper.cn reported.The company had also asked workers to install a smart managing app on their mobile phones, which will record their location and movement. The location system only works during work hours, which will not infringe on workers' privacy, the staff noted, adding that no worker had been punished for information provided by the watches so far. A sanitation worker told the Jiangsu City Channel that he felt monitored and not free after wearing the watch, while others said the watch did not affect them.  However, most Chinese netizens condemned the company of treating its workers like "prisoners." Zhang Xinnian, a Beijing-based lawyer told the Global Times on Sunday that the watches' monitor function violated the workers' privacy.Newspaper headline: Sanitation company removes alarms on workers China to be offered Russia's 'best warplane' Su-57New Zealand Prime Minister visits ChinaIndia's nationalistic media could disrupt China-India ties Seeing the futureAllahu Akbar
