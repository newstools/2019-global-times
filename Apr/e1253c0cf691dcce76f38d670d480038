Supporters of the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) celebrate victory at its headquarters in Madrid, Spain, on April 28, 2019. The Spanish Socialist Party of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez led in the Spanish election on Sunday when 95.6 percent of the votes were counted, but will need to pact with other parties to form a government.

The results raise the specter of another period of instability for Spain, with Sanchez depending on alliances with hostile rivals in an environment that has soured since Catalonia's failed secession bid in 2017.A significant development was the rise of the ultranationalist Vox party, which garnered just over 10 percent of the vote in a country that has had no far-right party to speak of since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.Sanchez's Socialist Party got 123 ­lawmakers out of 350, or close to 29 percent of votes - short of an absolute ­majority but much better than the 85 seats it got in 2016. "The Socialists have won the general election and with it the future has won and the past has lost," he told cheering supporters from the ­balcony of the ­party's headquarters in Madrid, claiming victory late Sunday.The big loser was the conservative Popular Party, which bagged 66 seats compared to 137 in the previous election that saw it govern Spain with a minority government.Sanchez, who came to power in June after ousting conservative prime minister Mariano Rajoy in a no-confidence vote, could seek to forge alliances with far-left Podemos and smaller groupings like Catalan separatist parties, as he had done over the past 10 months.He could also try to cosy up to ­center-right Ciudadanos, which won 57 seats. Together, they would form an absolute majority but voters from both ­parties would likely frown on such a move."I hope Sanchez won't reach an agreement with Ciudadanos, I want a left-wing government," 51-year-old ­Esther Lopez said at the Socialist Party headquarters.Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera built his campaign on disparaging Sanchez, criticizing his attempts to negotiate with Catalan separatist parties in a bid to ease a secession crisis in the northeastern region.In an editorial Monday, Madrid daily El Mundo called on Sanchez to "reach out to Rivera and consider forming a moderate government - which would undoubtedly go down well in Europe - to ensure the stability" of the country.
