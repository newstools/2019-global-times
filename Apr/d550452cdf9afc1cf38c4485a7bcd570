China is planning to mobilize more than 10 million young volunteers to help promote cultural, technological and medical development in rural areas by 2020, a move local officials said would help revitalize rural areas that are suffering from an outflow of talented and young workers. These young volunteers will be sent to rural areas, especially old revolutionary base areas, regions of extreme poverty and areas where ethnic minority groups live to promote local development and improve personal skills, read a recent document released by the Communist Youth League of China (CYL). The move was hailed by many local officials, who said that it would help revitalize rural areas in the country that have been suffering from talent and labor outflows. "We need young people to use science and technology to help the countryside innovate its traditional development models," Zhang Linbin, deputy head of a township in Central China's Hunan Province, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Zhang noted that young people are passionate and active, which is what rural areas need.Taking his daily work as an example, Zhang noted that they were in urgent need of people who know computers because they were pushing forward a more standardized and digitized job in the town.The rising level of urbanization in China has made more young people migrate from rural areas or less-developed regions to developed areas that have better resources and better income. This drains rural areas of their labor force. To try to reverse the drain, the country has implemented a raft of policies in recent years to help rural areas attract skilled labor. The document vowed to mobilize 10,000 student members of the Communist Party of China and the CYL to serve in rural areas as part-time local level officials, in order to train them in rural governance.It vowed to build a number of training bases for young people in rural areas to start their own businesses or find jobs and to train more than 200,000 young people by 2020. In the 1960s-70s under the influence of the Cultural Revolution, (1966-76) the Party sent millions of urban teenagers to rural areas to live and participate in the so-called Down to the Countryside Movement.
