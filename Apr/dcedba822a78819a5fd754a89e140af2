 Since China and the US became engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff spat last year, scholars and politicians from both sides have debated over the decoupling of the world's two biggest economies and its world impact.One year later, the trade war has begun to show signs of ending, while the debate rages on.The latest round of such discussions in the US was reported by Voice of America earlier this week, citing US analysts' commentaries as to whether it is feasible for China and the US to decouple and whether it will make the US more secure, or the other way around.The topic has also been discussed in China, as the two countries are believed by some scholars to be engaged in a technology Cold War that could split the world into two camps. Restrictive US measures on academic and business exchanges with China, and harsh criticism of China's human rights issues and diplomatic policies from senior US politicians, have also triggered such concerns.Some neo-conservatives, such as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, cannot live without labeling an enemy and for them, it's always about a win-lose instead of win-win situation, said Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, calling such a mentality as "losing contact with reality."  Definition mythMeanwhile, industry insiders and scholars noted that when the word "decoupling" was translated into Chinese as tuogou, which stresses the idea of completely disconnecting from each other, it generates a different tone of discussion in China than in the US. "Under its original meaning in the technology sector, the decoupling of China and the US means they develop separately with their own strategies, but the execution of one side still calls for open, trustworthy and valuable support from the other. That is not necessarily a bad thing," Chris Dong, an industry analyst and global research director from International Data Corp, which oversees the Chinese and US technology sectors, told the Global Times. "But if you define the word as delink, or disconnect, the statement is false as it is unrealistic for the world's two biggest economies to get rid of each other, and even if they do so, it will lead to a global recession," said Dong. When the Global Times reporter reached out to Chinese businesspeople and those studying in the US on China-US tuogou, most of the answers were "impossible, unrealistic and impractical."Zhao Taotao, a consultant at a study-abroad agency in Zhengzhou, Central China's Henan Province, told the Global Times that the situation is unlikely to happen, at least in the education industry."As long as the US enjoys an advantage in higher education, Chinese parents will not stop sending their children there. US colleges also need Chinese students as a source of campus diversity and funding," she said.  According to the 2019 QS World University Rankings, four US universities rank in the top five and over one-tenth of top 1,000 global universities are in the US.Though some US political elites and anti-China hardliners are advocating the decoupling of China and the US, starting from economic, diplomatic and security sectors, it is almost impossible for them to achieve the goal for now, said Li.In sectors that are less political, such as people-to-people and cultural exchanges, the issue seems even less likely, considering how intertwined China and the US have been in the past half century, analysts said. Meanwhile, state governments, companies, academic institutions and social groups in the US can act against federal policy that they consider "short-sighted, fatuous or hurting themselves," said Li.Both sides should have an objective understanding of how much they need each other and avoid having too big an ego, said Dong.Who's the victim There are those who have warned that the decoupling of China and the US and "out-China" strategy would hurt US interests.Some have called for decoupling and isolating China through a new Cold War, which would be very costly and too hostile a response, David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former official at the US Treasury Department, wrote in an article published on the website of the think tank in March. By 2017, there were 144 countries that had more trade with China than with the US, including 50 countries in Africa and all countries in Asia except Afghanistan and Bhutan, Dollar said."If we try to isolate China, our partners are not likely to follow us, which could isolate ourselves instead," he said.Former US deputy assistant secretary of state Susan Shirk also warned that a decoupling of US and Chinese economies could be "apocalyptic" and that any attempt to do so would be "absolutely disastrous.""It could [lead to] delocalization, and no country wants to choose between the US and China," she said, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported in March.Neither China nor the US should underestimate their dependence on each other, as well as how much their decoupling would hurt global industrial growth, Chinese analysts stressed.Those who want to "decouple" the two economies are engaged in "wishful thinking," Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference on March 8 on the sidelines of China's annual two sessions."Decoupling from China would mean decoupling from opportunities, from the future, and, in a sense, from the world," Wang warned at the press conference. China and the US can be strategic cooperation partners, though they are currently in dispute on many issues. The US side has paid more attention to "disputes" while China focuses on "cooperation," said Dong.Dong also warned that the discussion should not be used to incite nationalist sentiment in China, which will lead to blind confidence and a waste of resources in industrial development.China-US ties should not be defined by an individual case or incident, no matter how influential or dramatic it is, said analysts, noting that the majority of China-US exchanges are healthy and benefit both sides.
