Chinese digital image service provider Visual China Group (VCG), known as the Chinese counterpart of Getty Images, has been under fire in recent days after the company reportedly claimed copyrights on the first-ever black hole photo as well as the Chinese flag and national emblem.VCG's shares opened 25.20 yuan ($4) on Friday, taking a dive by the daily limit of 10 percent, after representatives of the company were summoned by regulators in North China's Tianjin Municipality in midnight Thursday for "containing sensitive and harmful information in some of its photo captions" that cause serious damage, said a post on the authority's WeChat account.Tianjin regulators Friday sent an inspection team to the company to inspect potential problems and supervise the rectification. VCG's website has been shut down. Other domestic photo providers like quanjing.com also became inaccessible on Friday.China's National Copyright Administration (NCA) issued a statement on Friday, urging image providers to strengthen their management mechanism of intellectual property (IP). The administration vowed to carry out measures to regulate the market order of image IPs.VCG apologized on Weibo, saying that "We accept the scrutiny and criticism of netizens and media and will coordinate with the supervision department for a thorough rectification." On Weibo, a hashtag titled "VCG apologizes" was viewed 290 million times and discussed 49,000 times as of Friday afternoon. Chinese netizens also mocked VCG's practice of claiming a copyright on public domain images by creating a new discussion titled "Everything belongs to VCG."Industry insiders said the heated discussions on social media show the growing awareness of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection among Chinese residents. In fact, the set-up of photo service providers has largely reduced copyright infringement practices, which used to be rampant on the internet, and strengthened IPR protection in China during the past decade, a photographer surnamed Cui told the Global Times on Friday.The scandal shows that some Chinese companies that profit under the guise of IPR still have not formed a comprehensive understanding of IPR."China's IPR protection has entered a crucial stage, and the case showed that it is important to clarify what a genuine IPR is," said Li Min, a Shanghai-based lawyer.
