The company is also the sole Asian automobile enterprise of 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), an international cross-industry organization of companies from the auto, technology and telecommunications sectors.Betting on the new trends for global auto industry - electrification, intelligence and sharing - the Chinese company, owning British car brand MG and its MAXUS brand, has seen its sales of self-owned brands achieve 827,900 units in 2018, an increase of 28.3 percent year-on-year. The sales volume of SAIC's NEV reached 140,000 last year, up 120 percent year-on-year.Lei Ming, deputy managing director of SAIC Motor International Business Department, told a briefing on Monday that the company aims to build 50,000 public charging piles with an investment of $3 billion by 2020.After a decade of development, China's NEVs are starting to gain momentum. Amid sluggish overall auto sales last year, the NEV sector has become the industry's sales engine. During 2018, more than 1 million passenger NEVs were sold, up 88.5 percent year-on-year, according to the China Passenger Car Association."With cars becoming electric, related design work has also become challenging. In the meanwhile, how to cater to the young people is another focus," said Shao Jingfeng, global design director of SAIC Motor Passenger Vehicle Co.He told the Global Times on the sidelines that it is a global issue for designers to make breakthroughs in the design for EVs since Tesla has gone some way in this regard, making it difficult for traditional auto giants to renovate.Beyond the new frontiers on future cars, SAIC is pushing hard its globalization strategy. It will launch its first pure electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) for the global market - MG EZS - in the third quarter this year, being the first Chinese automaker to do so, according to Shao.Last year, it had 277,000 units of sales in overseas markets, including six key markets - Thailand, the UK, Indonesia, Chile, Australia and New Zealand, a 62.5 percent increase year-on-year.Zuo Chen, marketing director of MG Thailand Sales Co, told the Global Times on Monday that the brand is trying to explore the emerging Southeast Asian markets. "Different from the domestic market, where various auto players can provide their products for consumers to choose from, Thai consumers are usually faced with fewer alternatives like several big brands."Long dominated by Japanese brands, the Thai auto market has seen MG take up a market share of just 2.4 percent, according to a Nikkei report in December 2018. Two SUV models - MG ZS and MG GS - contribute 70 percent of MG sales in Thailand.In November 2017, MG offered a Thai-language i-smart connectivity system in the local market, through which drivers can commend their cars with voice recognition.
