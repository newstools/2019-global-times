Photo: VCGUS officials have in recent days floated compromises in several sticking issues in the ongoing trade negotiations between China and the US, signaling that a final agreement to end the tariff war could be within reach.However, despite growing optimism out of Washington, Chinese analysts warned that there is more work to be done and risks persist, given the deterioration in the overall China-US relationship.In what has been received in China as a compromise on the part of the US, Reuters, citing unidentified sources, reported on Monday that US officials have watered down their demand for China to curb its industrial subsidies due to strong resistance from Chinese officials.To reach a deal in the next month or so, US officials have shifted focus away from the thorny issues toward other areas where their demands are more achievable, according to Reuters. Although there will be language on the subsidy issues, it will not be "very detailed or specific."Â Chinese officials have pushed back US accusations that the Chinese government gives state-owned enterprises (SOEs) subsidies. During a press briefing in March, Xiao Yaqing, head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, said that China "has no special arrangement for extra subsidies to SOEs" and that industrial policies are carried out in line with market rules.In another sign of compromise, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that the US is willing to face penalties if it did not honor commitments under a trade agreement, Bloomberg said.Chinese officials have repeatedly demanded that any enforcement must be two-way street, and that both sides should be subject to repercussions if they did not live up to their commitments."That the US is giving up some demands means that the two sides are making new progress in the talks," said Mei Xinyu, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. "As we have been saying all this time, for there to be a deal, both sides must make compromises."Mei said that given the growing optimistic signs, the two sides could be near a final deal to end the war.After nine rounds of face-to-face meetings, Chinese and US officials have continued talks over the phone and are making "all efforts" to conduct serious negotiations, Gao Feng, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said on Thursday.However, nothing is certain till the last minute as new demands might emerge, according to Liang Haiming, dean of Hainan University's Belt and Road Research Institute."We can only say that [the talks] are near the end at the current phase," Liang, who follows the talks closely, told the Global Times on Monday. "Businessmen tend to raise demands right before the signing of a deal and ask the other side to accept extra conditions. This has happened before."Liang said that the US has a history of walking back from a deal it has agreed to and coming back to ask for more. In May 2018, Chinese and US officials agreed to put the trade war on hold after talks, but the US later backpedaled on its commitment and launched the trade war."There is still a risk that the US might come up with something new. That's something we need to watch out for," Mei said, noting that China-US relations are likely to see more tension ahead, given the latter's growing suspicion of China based on unsubstantiated accusations.Newspaper headline: US floats trade compromises Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Chinese company BYD announces 300th bus production in LancasterSan Diego says farewell to giant pandasSeeing the future
