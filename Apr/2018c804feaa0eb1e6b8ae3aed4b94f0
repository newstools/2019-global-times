The added value for industrial enterprises increased by 5.3 percent year-on-year in the first two months, among which new industries and new products grew rapidly, and the added value of strategic emerging industries increased by 10.1 percent, the Beijing-based Economy Daily reported on Saturday.More and more young people are attracted to new careers like industrial robot system operators, e-sportsmen and drone controllers, and training institutions in this sector are also growing rapidly, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday.Du Hongyuan, a young Beijing-based drone controller trainer was quoted in the Xinhua report as saying that a monthly salary of more than 10,000 yuan ($1,489) and interesting work experience drew him into career training in 2015, and he has seen even more young people join the business.Yang Lijun, a robot operator with Sany Heavy Industry Co, said that he is not worried about being replaced by robots, although mechanical automation is indeed a major trend in industrial manufacturing, Xinhua reported.The new job titles are in line with China's quality development strategy, indicating China will adopt more measures to expand the ranks of its intellectual and technical workers, who play crucial roles in sustainable economic development, especially in big cities, Yuan Fuhua, director of the economic growth office of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday."To maintain employment should not only be interpreted as maintaining the number of people employed - it should also improve the employment quality," Yuan said."A growing pool of educated and trained engineers and technicians means much more for sustainable development than how many properties each person owns," Yuan added.Newspaper headline: Govt announces 13 new job titles in technology China to be offered Russia's 'best warplane' Su-57New Zealand Prime Minister visits ChinaIndia's nationalistic media could disrupt China-India ties Seeing the futureAllahu Akbar
