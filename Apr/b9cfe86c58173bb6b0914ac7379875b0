File photo: VCGChina's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday issued scathing criticism of a controversial Australian law that forces technology companies to give Australian authorities access to encrypted data, in an apparent bid by Chinese officials to step up their offense against what they call biased actions by Australia toward Chinese companies. Asked about Australian legislation, which was passed in 2018 and staunchly opposed by global technology giants, Lu Kang, a spokesperson for the ministry, did not hold back, attacking Australia's selfishness in passing such a law that could threaten other countries' national security."Such a move to force companies to install a 'back door' through legislation is putting one's own security and interests above other countries' security and their citizens' privacy," Lu told a press briefing in Beijing, adding the move will have major impact on the global telecom industry.Since its passage, the law, said to be the first of its kind in any Western country, has attracted widespread criticism, particularly from global technology giants including Google, Apple and Facebook, which have been calling for changes to the law."This law challenges every basic law and rule within the industry because it is like giving Australian authorities an all-purpose warrant to look at any data at any time they want," said Shen Yi, head of Fudan University's Cyberspace Governance Research Institute. "It would set a dangerous precedent for others."But apart from these potential dangers, the law also laid bare Australia's bias and double standards when it comes to Chinese companies, officials and analysts said."What's confusing is that a certain country, on one hand, often cites cyber security in hyping up unwarranted speculation of the so-called 'security threat' of other countries or companies. On the other hand, it does something to endanger cyber security," Lu said. "Like you, I would also like to hear how the Australian government explains this."Lu was apparently referring to Australia's ban on Chinese telecom company Huawei from its 5G network development, based on accusations that Huawei was working for the Chinese government and thus posing a security risk for Australia. Both the Chinese government and Huawei have vehemently denied such accusations. Shen said that the bias and double standards employed by Australian officials are crystal clear, but by taking an aim at this situation, China is previewing a more aggressive approach toward Australia. "I think this gives China the higher moral ground to take on Australia," Shen said.Chinese analysts have also suggested in recent weeks that after resolving tensions with several partners such as the US, the EU and New Zealand, China should take a firmer stance against Canada and Australia for unfair practices against Chinese companies and citizens.Commenting on the Australian law last month, Chen Lifang, a senior vice president at Huawei, said it was "shocking" to learn that Australia would force companies to work with its security and law enforcement agencies. "Huawei would never work with any government or intelligence agency," Chen told reporters on March 29.
