The first batch of 6 million of Huawei's P30 and P30 pro models, which will be launched on the domestic market in Shanghai on Thursday, were made at Zhengzhou as well.An employee of an upstream industry equipment supplier surnamed Li told the Global Times on Tuesday that he heard the new Huawei units had been assembled at the G section, which launched production in 2018.Another employee from an equipment supplier, surnamed Zhang, said on Wednesday that the K and L sections are also making Huawei devices  now."Foxconn has already started turning to Huawei, as it is gearing up to launch new devices to win the 5G race and top the world's smartphone manufacturers," Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Wednesday."As a developed assembler, it's not hard for Foxconn to update an assembly line. It's not even hard to update 4G smartphone assembly lines to produce 5G devices," Xiang said.About a dozen workers at the Foxconn Zhengzhou plant told the Global Times on Wednesday that the current order drop is just a normal part of  seasonal ups and downs."After Apple launches a new device, earlier models usually become more popular as prices are cut," said Jia. "That's been the pattern for several years."However, the situation is not the same this time. Apple launched no new devices at the spring event in March, and it may also miss launching a 5G device this year, media reports said.Foxconn is also reportedly planning a semiconductor factory in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province, 21jingji.com reported on Wednesday. Analysts said that Foxconn's semiconductor company aims to build a complete industry chain. The entire industry chain of China's smartphone manufacturing sector is being upgraded, although it's still not strong in terms of core parts, Fu Liang, a senior industry analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday."Huawei has developed its own chipsets, and BOE Technology Group Co has made breakthroughs in displays as well. In general, our industry chain capacity is improving," Fu said.Newspaper headline: Era of 5G telecoms dawns at Foxconn facility Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Seeing the futureAllahu Akbar
