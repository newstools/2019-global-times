A State Council executive meeting concluded Wednesday has called for benefiting more people when they seek medical care. The conference called for further promoting a pilot medicine procurement program, short supply medicine monitoring and coping measures, as well as medical assistance. The pilot medicine procurement program was tested in 11 major cities to lower drug prices and reduce the burden on patients. A total of 25 drugs were selected and their prices were cut down by 52 percent on average, with the biggest drop rate over 90 percent. The medicine procurement program should be further improved while quality supervision and supply guarantee of selected drugs should be strengthened, so as to lessen the price and benefit the people.
