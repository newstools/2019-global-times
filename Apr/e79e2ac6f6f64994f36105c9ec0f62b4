Heisei came from Chinese classics Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Documents.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the new era's name "symbolizes our nation's profound public culture and long tradition," AFP reported Monday."Just like amazing plum flowers in full bloom that signal the arrival of spring after bitter cold, each and every Japanese person can hope for the future and make their own flowers blossom," the prime minister said."It is the first time it comes from a Japanese text" rather than Chinese, noted Abe, known for his nationalist stance. Although it is seen as a Japanese classic, according to public documents, the Manyoshu was influenced by the themes, forms, and ways of expression of ancient Chinese poems. The Manyoshu includes a collection of 118 poems about plum blossom, which reflects Chinese influence. And since "Wa" also means "Japanese style," Reiwa could mean the harmony of China-Japan ties, Katou Takanori, a Japanese professor at the Cheung Kong School of Journalism and Communication of Shantou University, and a former editorial board member of Yomiuri Shimbun, told the Global Times on Monday."Not taking the name from the Chinese classics for the first time might be a reflection of Japan's political concerns under Abe's conservative government," said Liu Junhong, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. "The choice shows the rise of nationalism and conservatism in Japan. Japan hopes to be an independent political power and that its status will not be affected by other countries," Liu said.Japan is the only country in the world that uses the era name system, which has its roots in China, though the Gregorian calendar is also in common use. Japan has had nearly 250 eras since adopting the system in the 7th century, and in recent times, one era has run the entire length of a monarch's rule, reported the Japan Times.The gengo is a matter of huge public interest in Japan as it will be widely used in calendars, newspapers, official documents and certificates including drivers' licenses, said Kyodo News."Learning from others or taking good things from others for reference is a good quality of Japan. There is no need to over-analyze the meaning behind Reiwa. Gengo is just Japan's cultural heritage," Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations, told the Global Times on Monday.Asked about China's comments on the new era name on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said: "We have no comment on this since it is Japan's internal affair."However, Geng said that "we are willing to work with Japan on the basis of the principles of the four political documents of China and Japan to continue to promote the healthy and stable development of China-Japan relations and to contribute to peace, stability and development in the region and the world."
