The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is injecting great impetus to China's transition of the overall diplomatic strategy and helping expand its friendship network as the initiative has not only brought common prosperity but also enhanced policy coordination and closer people-to-people ties.Leaders from 37 countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose country became the first G7 member to sign up to the initiative, are in Beijing for the Second Belt and Road Forum and have held talks with President Xi Jinping from Wednesday to Friday.During the talks, the heads of state have not only agreed to advance pragmatic cooperation in economic areas such as trade, energy, infrastructure and the high-tech sector, but also pledged to promote bilateral ties and safeguard regional security and stability.Chinese analysts noted that the BRI is not only an economic initiative to promote road interconnectivity, unimpeded trade and currency convertibility, but also exerting more influence in promoting China's diplomatic strategy transition."The BRI has helped China expand its global friendship network, which shows that China is playing an increasingly pivotal role in promoting regional development and safeguarding multilateralism," Li Xiangyang, director of the National Institute of International Strategy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday.The initiative, which focuses on utilizing market and economic resources to explore new diplomatic relations with other countries, also drives the country's transition to economic diplomacy, Li said.He noted that this strategy could help enhance the acknowledgement of people in BRI-participating countries of China's intention of peaceful development and not an expansive strategy or a new "Marshall Plan," as promoting BRI fits the world's common interests.The cooperation scheme of "six corridors and six channels serving multiple countries and ports" under the BRI has been formed, and a large number of cooperation projects have been materialized.Russian supportPresident Xi held talks with Putin on Friday in Beijing. Stressing that Russia is an important partner in the development of the BRI, Xi said aligning the BRI with the Eurasian Economic Union is a model of regional economic cooperation, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The BRI has provided an important platform and sets a successful example for expanded international cooperation, and won increasing support from the international community, Putin said, adding that the presence of so many state leaders and representatives at this forum is proof.Previously, Russia showed some concerns over the BRI, as the country feared the initiative would threaten the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, along with a greater understanding of the initiative, combined with pressure from the West, Russia decided to stand together with China, Liu Qing, director of the department for Asia-Pacific security and cooperation at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday. Russia's support for the BRI will have an effect on Central Asian and Eastern European countries, and Russia will bridge China with them, Liu said.Analysts noted the forum has become a platform for China and other countries to communicate and coordinate in international and regional affairs.Xi and Putin also exchanged views on the situation on the Korean Peninsula and Venezuela, after Putin held talks on Thursday with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Russia's Far East port city of Vladivostok."Because China and Russia have almost the same interests in the Korean Peninsula, the two countries are working together for the denuclearization of the peninsula," Liu said.In less than two years, great progress has been made on the Korean Peninsula issue with the goal of denuclearization confirmed by Pyongyang and other parties involved. However, the mutual distrust between the US and North Korea has been an obstacle to an agreement. China and Russia can and should act as a credit guarantor to help improve mutual trust between the US and North Korea and push the resumption of the Six-Party Talks, analysts said.On Wednesday, Xi met with Toshihiro Nikai, the Japanese prime minister's special envoy and secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, and said the two countries should implement their political consensus that "they never pose a threat to each other" and that "they are cooperative partners who support each other's peaceful development," Xinhua reported. Nikai said the BRI is a grand vision with great potential, adding that the Japanese side appreciates China's important contributions to the world and the region through this initiative.In talks with Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday, Xi said China is willing to work with Myanmar to safeguard the security and stability of China-Myanmar border areas and ensure the safety and order of border residents.Suu Kyi said Myanmar believes joint construction of the initiative will lead to greater well-being in the world and the region, enhance Myanmar-China friendship and cooperation, and bring concrete benefits to the two peoples.On Thursday, Xi met with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and said the two sides should strengthen planning, enlarge the cooperation platform and promote high-quality cooperation. He added the two joint industrial parks in Qinzhou, China and Kuantan, Malaysia should be well built into an important connecting point for the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, promoting connectivity and development of the two countries and the region.Mahathir said the BRI is a great initiative with huge potential, which will not only help deal with the infrastructure and transport bottlenecks that are impeding the development of different countries, but also address the problem of unbalanced development among countries and promote cultural dialogue and exchanges.In other bilateral talks, Xi also met with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, according to Xinhua.
