Photo: ICChina is expected to increase corn imports in the coming years after having reduced stockpiles in recent years, according to a report published on Saturday. However, the country will not change its import quota and tariffs policy for the crop, and it will not increase imports from the US as the latter has demanded, experts said.China will increase corn imports in the next decade because domestic supply cannot meet demand, China Central Television reported on Sunday, citing the China Agricultural Outlook (2019-2028).Corn planting areas and production have both fallen for three years in a row, and the downtrends are expected to continue this year, according to the annual report of the 2019 China Agricultural Outlook Conference, which was released in Beijing on Saturday.Meanwhile, consumption of animal feed and deep processing will continue to grow, and inventories will continue to drop, the report said.The declines have been caused by adjustment measures that China adopted in recent years that aimed to reduce corn stockpiles, Jiao Shanwei, editor-in-chief of cngrain.com based in Central China's Henan Province, told the Global Times Sunday.China's corn inventories hit 260 million tons in 2016, according to media reports. The current corn storage is less than 80 million tons, according to media reports in November 2018.Measures to reduce planting areas, combined with a temporary program to auction inventories, have had an effect. Destocking made faster progress than expected in 2018 and will be finished this year, the Xinhua News Agency reported in January, citing an official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.The area of land devoted to growing corn won't recover until 2020, Xu Shiwei, an expert at the agriculture ministry, said during the conference, CCTV reported.Corn imports reached 3.52 million tons in 2018 and are expected to reach 3.6 million tons in 2019 and 4 million tons in 2020, Xu added. China's import quota for corn this year totals 7.2 million tons. China levies a 1 percent tariff on imports within the quota and a 65 percent tariff on imports exceeding the quota, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.But that doesn't mean China will change its tariff rate quota system for corn, according to analysts.A WTO panel decided on Thursday that the system had violated international trading rules. The case was filed by the administration of former US president Barack Obama in December 2016 before current US President Donald Trump launched the trade war. The Obama administration said the system denied US farmers access to the China market.China's Ministry of Commerce said Friday that it "regrets" the ruling and will "seriously study" the decision.China will maintain reasonable quota systems for rice, wheat and corn imports, because these items are related to China's food security, Jiao said.A higher corn price from a tighter supply and demand balance will encourage more domestic farmers to increase corn production, so the balance will recover, Jiao said."Even if China imports up to 7.2 million tons of corn, it still just accounts for no more than 2 percent of the country's total corn consumption," Jiao added.China imported 312,300 tons of corn from the US in 2018, or 8.9 percent of total corn imports, according to media reports.Although the WTO's ruling obviously favors the US wish to expand corn exports to China, the latter will retain the quota system and will not increase corn imports from the US as it has demanded, said Mei Xinyu, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation."China will maintain its import policies on special products like rice, wheat and corn," Mei told the Global Times Sunday.Newspaper headline: China to increase imports of corn Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Having funChinese company BYD announces 300th bus production in LancasterSan Diego says farewell to giant pandas
