Visitors explore the Golden Stairs exhibition. Photo: Courtesy of the Hongkun Museum of Fine ArtThe Hongkun Museum of Fine Art's newest exhibition is inspired by the theme song of the old Taiwan TV series Golden Stairs. The group exhibition in Beijing features various kinds of exhibits from 10 artists from very different backgrounds.  In modern times, stairs have largely been replaced by fast elevators or escalators, mainly being delegated to being used as fire escapes. But stairs' ability to allow people to travel up or down still remains an important metaphor for describing the differences in society such as class and status.The curator explained that materialism in today's society has become the measuring stick for success and the infinitely ambiguous pursuit of power and wealth. Pointing out an interesting coincidence, curator Feng Xi noted that Chen Guifen, the lyricist for Golden Stairs' theme song, has the same name as the mother of Dai Chenlian, one of the exhibition's featured artists.The exhibition features the artistic Dream Youth of a New Successful Businessman by Niu Heyin, Wu Qiang's Chinese New Year series of paintings as well as artworks showcasing Dai's emotional ties with his mother, who supported him by doing jobs like house cleaning. The exhibition is set to run until July 19.
