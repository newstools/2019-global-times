At Peking University, where the movement was initially started in 1919, activities such as a 5.4-kilometer run were held recently. Just like the young students 100 years ago, students nowadays share the mission of building a strong country and to combine their pursuits of life with the needs of the country and the era, said Zhuang Deshui, a professor specializing in the study of public policy and social governance at Peking University.   The essence of patriotism for young students in this new era is to devote themselves to the country's development, at a time when China faces very different challenges and international responsibilities than it did 100 years ago, Chinese scholars noted.For the bigger goal The significance of commemorating the movement now is to encourage the young generation to connect their own destiny with the destiny of China and contribute their share to social development, said Zhou Jiaqi, a PhD student at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Renmin University of China. "It's the young generation's responsibility and mission in China. And we the young people should have the spirit of 'daring to be the first,'" Zhou said. "For me, patriotism means fulfilling my mission to tell China's story well and better deliver China's voice and values to the world." At a group study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held on April 19, Xi stressed efforts to strengthen studies of the May Fourth Movement and its spirit, in order to motivate young people to make unremitting contributions to national rejuvenation.Xi stressed the need to enhance "political guidance" on the young people and lead them to voluntarily uphold Party leadership and follow Party policies.  "It has been proved that only the leadership of CPC can better promote the social development of China, and the young students must follow the Party," said Zhuang. "While some foreign scholars said the CPC's governance of China cannot last for three generations, this idea has proved to be an illusion. The world also expects to see how the young generation, China's future leaders, will carry on with CPC's policy and governance philosophy," said Zhuang.
