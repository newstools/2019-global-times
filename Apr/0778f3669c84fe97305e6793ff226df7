Together with other CEEC leaders, they also visited an exhibition on China-CEEC education cooperation, and attended a matchmaking meeting for SMEs from China and the CEECs.More than 1,000 delegates from the governments, as well as business and industrial communities of China and the CEECs attended the opening ceremony.
