President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called on the Communist Party of China (CPC) to shoulder the political responsibility of nurturing a new generation of capable young people who have a good and all-round moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetical grounding in addition to a hardworking spirit, and who are well-prepared to join the socialist cause. Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at a gathering marking the centenary of the May Fourth Movement in Beijing. "We should listen to young people's views on social issues and phenomena, as well as their opinions and advices on the work of the Party and the government," he said. "Even if they express harsh or partial criticism, we should correct our mistakes when we have made any and guard against them when we have not," he said. Xi called on the Party to address young people's concerns in employment, starting business, integrating into the society, love, marriage and making friends, caring for the elderly and raising children, so as to create favorable conditions for their development. "We should educate and guide young people to view the world properly, to understand the national conditions comprehensively, and to grasp the trend of the era," he said.
