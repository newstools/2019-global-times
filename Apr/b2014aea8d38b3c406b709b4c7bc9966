The price of a 46-square-meter home in some communities in the city can be as low as 326 yuan ($49) per square meter, said the paper.cn on Monday. By comparison, in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang Province, the average price is nearly 20,000 yuan per square meter. The average second-hand home price in Beijing is more than 60,000 yuan per square meter in March, down 0.23 percent month-on-month, according to data released by industry information website esf.fang.com."The low home prices in Hegang are actually for units built in shanty towns. For normal commercial residential homes, the price is about 2,000 to 3,500 yuan per square meter, but that's still far cheaper than other cities in the country," a local surnamed Wu told the Global Times on Tuesday. "It's a normal phenomenon in third- and fourth-tier cities in Northeast China, where people are leaving while new homes are springing up - there's nobody to buy a home! The situation has persisted for many years," Liu Di, a property agent based in Shenyang, capital of Northeast China's Liaoning Province, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Hegang's development, which mainly relied on the coal industry in the past, lost its shine because of sluggish markets and adjustment in the sector during recent years, leading to an outflow of talent and capital to other cities, Yan Yuejin, research director at E-house China R&D Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Many local residents have moved to large nearby cities like Shenyang and Beijing while others like to buy homes in warmer regions like Sanya in South China's Hainan Province, Yan said.It's the same in other cities in Heilongjiang including Shuangyashan and Jixi, according to Liu. Wu, the Hegang native who now works in Hainan Province, said "many people from my hometown didn't return to Hegang after finishing school in other cities - me, too. It's not that we don't want to contribute to the development of our hometown, but we don't know what to do."Hegang's population is down nearly 50,000 since 2015, and the outflow of Liaoning reached 52,000 in 2018, media reports said.Northeast China's Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces accounted for 73 percent of the shrinking cities across the country in the past three years, according to a report by sohu.com on April 11. Local governments in the area are expected to nurture new industries and inject vitality into the local market, and efforts to improve infrastructure are also needed, experts said.These cities should attract investment and nurture competitiveness by strengthening the transformation and upgrading of the industrial structure, Yan said, noting cities like Hegang could tap their potential to develop new business in such sectors as tourism, forestry, and ice and snow tourism.Dandong, a border city in Liaoning Province, reported 1.9 percent month-on-month growth in home prices in March, leading 69 other cities surveyed by Chinese housing authorities, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday. Yan said that relatively loose home purchasing polices and improvements in local infrastructure are major forces driving up housing prices of Dandong.Home prices in first-tier cities have been cooling. The month-on-month growth in Beijing was 0.4 percent in March, while Shanghai had a decline of 0.1 percent. Prices in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province, were up 0.8 percent and Shenzhen in Guangdong saw prices fall 0.3 percent, said the NBS.
