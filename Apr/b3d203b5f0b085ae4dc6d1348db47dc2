China’s scheduled maritime parade in celebration of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy’s 70th anniversary is a sign of transparency rather than a show of naval prowess, a Chinese military expert said Saturday after foreign media accused China of showing military muscle.Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told the Global Times on Saturday that China’s planned demonstration of naval vessels in Qingdao, East China’s Shandong Province on April 23 is an indication that the PLA Navy is becoming more open and transparent.Zhang stressed that the Chinese parade is no muscle show at all. He said that as early as the 14th century, the UK started to hold maritime parades, and other countries have begun to hold these ceremonial activities since then.Zhang said that some other countries should not apply double standards here.Zhang’s remark came after Reuters said in a Saturday report that China “is flexing its increasingly well-equipped military muscle” through the naval celebration.“[The PLA Navy’s] showing of these weapons and equipment so close-up to foreign counterparts indicates nothing is hidden. This act shows that we are not hostile and that the PLA Navy’s wish to safeguard world peace and stability [is similar] with other navies around the world,” Zhang said.Qiu Yanpeng, the deputy commander of the PLA Navy, said at a press conference held ahead of the anniversary on Saturday that the aircraft carrier Liaoning, new nuclear-powered submarines, new destroyers and aircraft will participate in the April 23 fleet review, with some vessels making their public debut.More than 10 countries will send naval vessels to the parade, and more than 60 countries from five continents will send naval delegations.Qiu also said it is essential to build a strong navy because China was invaded more than 470 times from the sea, which caused deep suffering in the Chinese nation.By comparison, the PLA Navy has never caused any war, turbulence or unsettlement anywhere in the world, Qiu said.China is determined to pursue peaceful development and will never pursue hegemony, Qiu said.
