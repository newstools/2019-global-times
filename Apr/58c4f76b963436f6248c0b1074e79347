Illustrations: Liu Rui/GTRecently, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) released a report named the Panel Study of Chinese University Students. Findings suggest that students who order ready online meals have poor self-esteem, and are more likely to feel depressed. After ordering takeout food, which is common in Chinese universities, students generally eat cooped up in the seclusion of their dormitories. Although ordering takeout food does not necessarily lead to depression, it still shows that Chinese university students are becoming withdrawn. Online services - online takeout, online chat, and even online courses - give students reason to become "indoorsy." Universities need to encourage students to walk out their doors, explore the world around them and mix with more people. Students, more importantly, should try to be more open to social life. After all, humans are by nature social animals.
