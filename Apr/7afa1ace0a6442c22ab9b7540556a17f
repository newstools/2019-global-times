Belgium's center for cybersecurity has found no evidence that telecoms equipment supplied by Huawei could be used for spying, Reuters said.These developments proved again that most countries can independently make policy choices that meet their own interests, Lu said.Discriminatory measures that target certain countries in 5G development will not bring security but will disturb global supply chains and hinder technology application, Gao Feng, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Commerce, told a meeting on Thursday.Cybersecurity is a global challenge and no country can deal with it alone, Gao noted.Joining the US, Japan in December 2018 issued instructions banning government purchases of equipment from China's Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp, media reports said. China-Japan relations recently grew warmer, but the treatment of 5G technology will become a source of friction between the two countries amid China's trade tensions with the US, Fu Liang, a Beijing-based independent telecom analyst, told the Global Times. "Japan was largely influenced by the US" in its decision to ban Huawei, Fu said.As the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Huawei enjoys an edge in price compared with rivals, and Japan's ban will compel its carriers to spend more, Fu noted.Apart from the increasing cost, the ban would lead to chain reactions such as low efficiency in the industry, said Zhang Yi, CEO of iiMedia Research Institute, a mobile internet consulting firm based in South China's Guangdong Province. For instance, China is a leading global smartphone maker, and the products of Chinese makers basically comply with Huawei's standards. It will take a longer adaptation process after Japan abandons using Huawei's equipment and standards, according to Zhang."It's possible that retaliation measures would be rolled out toward relevant Japanese companies in the Chinese market by enhancing their access threshold, not only in the 5G sector but also in other industries," Zhang told the Global Times on Thursday.Industry insiders noted that Japan's restrictions on Huawei products will also affect the Chinese company's purchase of components in Japan, making local firms lose billions of dollars. Huawei bought 670 billion yen ($6 billion) worth of components from Japanese companies in 2018, according to domestic news site guancha.cn.
