He asked not to be named.The upper limit of the ticket price was not regulated, he noted, but nonetheless no cinema could justify setting random prices for hit movies.Such an approach "would only lead to chaos in the industry in the long run," he said. Beijing Normal University Professor Zhou Xing told the Global Times that it seemed like Chinese fans regarded attending the premiere like a "sacred ritual." They also fear unwanted spoilers, Zhou said.
