So she started singing a song in the language of her ethnic group, Derung, in her new two-story house."Having experienced the arduous years of being badly fed and clothed, I feel more about the greatness of the Communist Party of China. I want to use this song to express my gratitude to the Party for leading us to a better life," she sang.On Thursday, Xi wrote a reply letter to the Derung people, in which he encouraged them to build a good homeland, guard the border, and create a better future.As one of the country's smallest ethnic groups, Derung, which is estimated to be around 7,000 people, was lifted out of poverty in 2018. The Derung people live along the deep gorges of the Dulong River in Dulongjiang Township, Southwest China's Yunnan Province."Letting people of all ethnic groups have a good life has been my aspiration as well as our common goal," Xi wrote in his letter, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Since many of the ethnic groups live in mountainous regions and border areas far from the city and market, with natural conditions relatively harsh, their economic situations are generally not good.But in recent years, remarkable changes have been seen by Global Times reporters who went to these regions, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Guizhou and Yunnan, where ethnic minority groups live. Newly built houses, huge income increases as well as modern facilities have become a more common scene in these regions.Experts told the Global Times that rather than sacrificing the environment to boost the local economy, the government has explored new ways for ethnic groups, such as promoting their ethnic characteristics to attract tourism.No one left behindChina pledged to lift all poor population out of poverty by 2020. Tang Lixia, an expert at China Agricultural University, told the Global Times that measures to tackle poverty in ethnic minority regions include developing tourism and agriculture based on local resources, providing more years of free education to children as well as subsidies to those living along the border.In 2017, China demarcated three regions and three prefectures as the poorest areas. The three regions are located in Tibet, four regions in Southern Xinjiang and Tibetan-inhabited regions in Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu provinces. Three prefectures are located in Linxia in Gansu, Liangshan in Sichuan and Nujiang in Yunnan. More resources have been allocated to these areas.Tang said measures to tackle poverty in ethnic minority regions include developing tourism and agriculture based on local resources, providing longer years of free education to children as well as subsidies to those living along the border.Yu Minghua, an official handling poverty alleviation in Dulongjiang, said that the government provided villagers funds to build new houses. Some people in the village can make more than 50,000 yuan ($7,400) a year, which is more than double their past incomes."In the past, the area was blocked from the outside world every half year due to snow. In 2014, a tunnel was opened, which changed the situation," she told the Global Times on Friday. In Dulongjiang, they teach locals to grow Tsaok, a ginger-like plant, and outside companies come to buy it from villagers.In regions like Inner Mongolia and Southern Xinjiang, Global Times reporters have witnessed other innovative methods, including ecommerce, a collaborative business model which turns villagers into shareholders in small businesses to stimulate their energy, among others.The central government pledged to accelerate development of ethnic regions during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20), and set the target of achieving an annual gross regional product growth of over 8 percent in these regions as well as lifting 18.05 million people in rural areas out of poverty, Xinhua reported.In 2018, Xinjiang lifted 537,000 people out of poverty, a year-on-year drop of nearly half in poverty incidence in the region. In 2018, Tibet trained 36,000 poverty-stricken farmers and herdsmen, and provided 47,000 new jobs in ecological protection.The extreme poverty line by the World Bank is an income of $1.90 or less a day. For those being lifted out of poverty, their incomes are far above this line, with some earning more than 200,000 yuan a year.Models for others Dong Qiang, director of non-governmental organization Action Against Poverty, has conducted poverty alleviation work since 2015 with the government of Hebian village in Yunnan, where ethnic Yao people have lived.The villagers have all been lifted out of poverty and the village also has become a demonstration project for other Asian countries to emulate. The NGO has invited village chiefs from other Asian countries to visit and showcase Chinese experiences in poverty reduction.Dong said that many Asian countries have the same ethnic groups as China's. "Therefore, our experiences to use the resources of the ethnic groups to improve livelihood are also applicable to them."It is important to promote the model of involving NGOs in poverty alleviation to other countries, as NGOs can complement what the government does, he said. Tang said China has taken both general and targeted policies to ethnic groups which other developing countries should consider in their work.
