"I gave you [Lizhixing] 15 days, but you only told me you would change the engine. I am not satisfied with the work," she said.The dealership offered "three guarantees" after-sales service to the buyer, according to the video.Â However, Li Weimin, associate director of the rights and interests of consumers committee at the Beijing Lawyers Association, pointed out that the service could not apply here as the buyer did not even start using the car, which means the car itself failed to reach sales standards."Under this circumstance, the shop should not only refund the buyer but also compensate her with thrice the price," Li explained to the Global Times on Friday.He said that the dealership was cheating consumers if it really sold the car while knowing it had problems. The incident would damage the brand's reputation and Chinese consumers' trust in it, Li noted.Benz failed to respond to the Global Times over the incident as of press time.Some netizens showed appreciation for the buyer's way of safeguarding her rights, saying that merchants have to pay the price for their behavior.Many lamented that they felt helpless seeing an educated person have to act "shamelessly" to safeguard her rights.
