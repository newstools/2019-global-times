The visitors were urged to walk quickly as many were still waiting for their chance to get on board.Suzutsuki, the Japanese vessel, seemed to have taken extra care in preparing for the Open Day. In key areas including the vertical launch system and close-in weapon system, the ship prepared exhibition boards that explained their functions and technical details.The ship was loaded with safety measures including life jackets, ropes, life buoys and fire extinguishing facilities, all within easy reach, indicating high safety awareness and professionalism.

The Indian sailors behaved in a very gentlemanly way toward Chinese visitors, reminding them to be careful of the high thresholds when passing through doors. In one case, an Indian sailor warmly offered to help a Chinese woman carry her handbag as she descended a steep ladder.There was not as much lifesaving and damage control equipment on Kolkata as there was on Suzutsuki.

South Korean sailors also prepared jigsaw puzzles as presents to children who boarded the ship, saying, "This is a present for the children," in fluent Chinese.The Gyeonggi was the only foreign ship to open its control room to the public, showing the most transparency, while Suzutsuki and Kolkata only offered tours to their decks.The PLA Navy, on the other hand, opened the likes of Wuhu Type 054A frigate to the public.The Wuhu became a special attraction for Chinese visitors, as she was of the same type as the warship that appeared in hit Chinese movie Operation Red Sea.In the highly popular movie, a Type 054A frigate was deployed to rescue Chinese nationals from a fictional foreign country where a dangerous coup was taking place.Among the crowds of Chinese visitors, some were military enthusiasts who knew the ships well, while others only learned about them by looking up information on search engines.Regardless of the various level of familiarity with the warships, all the visitors seemed very happy and excited to get the chance to see the vessels up close.
