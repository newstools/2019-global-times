This prevented diffusion," said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities."Toyota on its own can't get key technology accepted, but if other companies use it, that offers the best chance of expansion," she added.Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor.Hybrid vehicles account for around 3 percent of all vehicles sold globally, eclipsing the roughly 1.5 percent share of all-battery EVs, according to LMC Automotive.The Japanese auto manufacturer also said that it had started to supply fuel cell vehicle parts to Chinese commercial vehicle makers Foton and SinoHytec, without giving financial details.The company said in a statement that it hopes to cooperate with more companies in China to promote fuel cell vehicle penetration in China.
