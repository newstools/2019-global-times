Shandong, which reportedly shut down more than 1,500 chemical plants in 2018, has also announced a three-month special safety inspection.Under harsh environmental regulations and pressure to cut excess capacity, local governments have already moved to relocate or close down chemical companies. At the end of 2018, local officials identified 1,176 companies that required rectification, including 337 that should be shut down, according to the Economic Information Daily. Wang Julin, a professor of College of Materials Science and Engineering at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday it's obvious that China is accelerating moves to rectify and shut down companies that use lots of energy, produce large amounts of pollution and have excess capacity, while stepping up plans to develop high added-value materials and products."China is upgrading the chemical industry to international standards. Energy-intensive products and basic materials are expected to be imported in the future," Wang added.Newspaper headline: Chemical industry set for massive changes Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Chinese company BYD announces 300th bus production in LancasterSan Diego says farewell to giant pandasSeeing the future
