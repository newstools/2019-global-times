"Energy-based cities and shrinking cities like Hegang [in Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province] are examples of places that greatly need a development transition," he said.The talent-attracting policies recently meted out by Hohhot, capital of North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, mainly target those who've graduated from colleges within the past three years, who are local residents, married and working in the science and technology area. For those who choose to buy a house, they can enjoy half the market price and those who choose to rent a house could enjoy free rent for two years, according to the city government statement Thursday."I would very much like to move back to Hohhot since the policy could ease the burden for the new graduates to start families," Li Lijuan, a technical company employee who works now in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday."If I worked in the designated area, I would buy a house for its property of high cost-performance ratio and better living convenience," Annie Lin, an immigrant in Australia whose hometown is Hohhot, told the Global Times Sunday.The policy is reasonable in giving the most generous benefits to particular groups as it is designed to lure the most desirable talent, Song added."It is the most powerful talent-attracting policy, as far as I concerned," Huang Jianzhong, an associate professor at Shanghai Normal University, told the Global Times on Sunday.In addition, the policy could also enliven the local real estate market to a certain extent, Huang added.The local real estate market will certainly see a short-term increase, while the overall housing market is not likely to be impacted by the new policies, said an employee surnamed Li from a real estate company based in Beijing.
