Welcome to Aidi kindergarten… Let's spend a happy day together!" Xiaopang said as it welcomes students at the kindergarten gate, shows a video provided by Ma.  Also, it can play games with children, and play music to coax them to take a break at midday, which makes it popular among children, according to Ma.The project has been welcomed by parents."Children don't make trouble and noise in class any more… as Xiaopang attracts their attention and gives good classes in a simple way," an emcee at a parent communication meeting said in another video provided by Ma to the Global Times.Ma said the robot has been tested in Xinjiang for nearly two weeks, and whether they will expand to more kindergartens and private preschool education institutes depends on how the robot performs with regard to safety and teaching efficiency.In recent years, Xinjiang has adopted various artificial intelligence (AI) training programs for children. The Sanlian children's training center in Urumqi provides a robot building and programming class for children between the ages of 4 and 16, Zhang Jing, the center's director told the Global Times Tuesday.Newspaper headline: Robot teacher starts school Chinese scientists design gene-editing tool using light to kill cancer cellsAbsence at PLA maritime parade will prevent US from learning about Chinese Navy: expertsChinese American organization condemns increasing racial profiling in US Having funChinese company BYD announces 300th bus production in LancasterSan Diego says farewell to giant pandas
