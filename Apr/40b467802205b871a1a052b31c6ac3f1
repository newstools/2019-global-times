US sanctions on Iran, rising unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and oil price volatility are dragging regional economic growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Monday. The IMF warned in a biannual economic outlook report that prospects for the region are "clouded by elevated levels of uncertainty.""Such uncertainty may increase investors' perception of risk for the whole region, leading to capital outflows and exchange rate pressure," it said.The IMF forecasts the economy in Iran, the second-largest in the region behind Saudi Arabia, will shrink by 6.0 percent this year after contracting by 3.9 percent in 2018.The bad news for Tehran comes after the US reimposed sanctions last year following its withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear accord.  Jihad Azour, IMF Middle East and Central Asia director, said the dire projection was made before the US tightened up measures targeting Iran's oil industry last week - meaning the pain could get even worse.  He said sanctions have already pushed inflation in Iran to around 50 percent.Iran's woes have a knock-on effect on regional figures.Overall regional economic growth was expected to remain subdued at 1.3 percent this year from 1.4 percent in 2018.For oil exporters, growth was down at 0.4 percent for 2019, while importing countries were expected to increase at 3.6 percent this year, from 4.2 percent in 2018.
