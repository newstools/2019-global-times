Illustration: Luo Xuan/GTAs a growing number of internet financing platforms get shut down for their inability to pay back investors, so macro oversight must be stepped up in order to stave off accumulating risks that may hamstring the security and stability of the country's financial system.In late March, Tuandai, a major online peer-to-peer financing vehicle based in Dongguan city, Guangdong Province, went bankrupt and hundreds of individual and institutional investors launched a protest demanding their investments be paid back. On April 1, local police announced they had detained 44 executives and mid-level managers of the company who prosecutors say will face criminal charges.The closure of Tuandai won't be a stand-alone case, as more than 200 similar online financing platforms scattered in first and second-tier Chinese cities are financially precarious. In past years, a string of online finance ventures went under, among which, Qianbao and Ezubo caused a national outcry.In Ezubo's case, two leading executives were sentenced in 2017 to life in prison and 24 employees received terms of three to 15 years for running a fraudulent online financing plan that amounted to a Ponzi scheme. The founder and CEO of Qianbao.com is being tried, with the court expected to announce a verdict soon.China's online lending platforms mushroomed from 2008 and reached their heyday around 2015, when a staggering 6,000 firms were set up, collecting institutional capital as well as the hard-earned savings of many ordinary people. Seeking higher investment returns promised by the P2P platforms, working-class families rushed to invest their money.Sadly, specific rules to oversee and guide the sector's healthy development were not as effective as expected. The tidal wave of internet financing was so ferocious, on such a global scale, that it swamped the regulators.The unruly P2P financing platforms in China were exploding, enveloping major cities in outright disarray, with many platforms resorting to using unscrupulous means or brazenly fraudulent Ponzi schemes to attract money from pensioners, college students and white-collar and blue-collar financial novices with little knowledge of financial market risks.As a result, few investors cheated by the fraudulent schemes get their money back, as their investment options end up in debt holes.Take Ezubo for instance. The platform swindled investors out of 60 billion yuan ($8.7 billion) via a string of fabricated investment projects. Ezubo chairman Ding Ning's management teams made up bogus investment projects in order to divert client funds for their own use. Up to 900,000 investors fell victim to Ezubo's fraudulent scam.In an affidavit, Ding admitted he collected a monthly salary of 1 million yuan. He splashed investors' money around on a lavish personal lifestyle as he spent an estimated 1.5 billion yuan on himself. To convince others that his company was highly successful, he asked two dozen of his secretaries to dress only in famous brands of clothing.Not until November 2017 did financial regulatory bodies in Beijing move to impose a series of restrictive rules to curb the rampant online lending industry. The rules allow only licensed platforms to issue credits, cap interest rates, and limit the geographical regions in which they can conduct their business.To help the sector grow in a healthy direction, regulators should continue to set clear-cut standards for the admittance of online financing platforms into the market, continuously improve their information disclosure mechanism, monitor their funding sources, and better protect consumer data collected by platforms.After all, regulators must strengthen industry oversight, and the mentality of letting "a fox guard the henhouse" must be discarded.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn China to be offered Russia's 'best warplane' Su-57New Zealand Prime Minister visits ChinaIndia's nationalistic media could disrupt China-India ties Seeing the futureAllahu Akbar
