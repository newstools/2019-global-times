A Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) interceptor takes off to hit one of India's satellites on March 27.

India's spending on space research almost tripled from 41.63 billion rupees ($602 million) in 2009-10 to 115.38 billion rupees in 2018-19, Indian news site business-standard.com reported in March.As a proportion of GDP, India spends about the same as China, with its space budget accounting for about 0.06 percent of GDP in 2018-19, the business-standard report showed, citing OECD data.Chinese Ministry of National Defense Spokesperson Wu Qian told a press conference on March 28 that China hopes nations will take real action to maintain peace in space, when asked to comment on India's ASAT missile test.The Indian system is like a combination of India's relatively mature ballistic missiles and missile defense interceptors, Wei said.
