A media group from Indonesia and Malaysia has visited Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to find out about China's policies on eradicating extremism.A total of 11 reporters from the two countries flew to Urumqi on Friday, visiting the regional museum and Xinjiang's largest Islamic Institution on Saturday.The media group was also scheduled to visit several places in the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, Kashi and Hotan, including factories in villages, which were built to lift local residents out of poverty, village schools, mosques, and vocational education and training centers in Kashi and Hotan.The media group visit followed a series of foreign media and diplomats coming to visit Xinjiang.On Saturday, the group visited the Islamic Institution in Xinjiang and met with Abudu Rikip, who is the head of the institution as well as the deputy president of China's Islamic Association.Rikip explained to the group the laws and regulations related to China's religious protection.He said that in recent years, Xinjiang had been plagued by extremism. The three evil forces of separatism, extremism and terrorism had distorted Xinjiang's history, deceived religious groups and stirred up terrorist attacks, which had severely affected the stability of Xinjiang and harmed local residents' lives.There have been no violent attacks in Xinjiang for more than two years, which can be seen as a major achievement for the current combined anti-extremism measures.The media group also interviewed students who were taking classes on religious knowledge on Saturday.At the request of a foreign reporter from Indonesia, a student named Nurahmat Yusuayin recited a part of the Quran.Another student, Yisihati Ayatibieke from theKazak ethnic group, was asked why he chose to study in the institution. He said that it was the largest Islamic Institution in Xinjiang and he wanted to inherit his religious culture and pass it on to others.  On Saturday, the media group also visited an exhibition hall in Urumqi, which displayed pictures and videos on terrorist attacks that have occurred in Xinjiang.Rahimy Bin A Rahim from Malaysia told the Global Times that he was not aware so many terrorist attacks had taken place in Xinjiang. He has now been given the full picture of the problems on extremism in Xinjiang, which is contrary to what some Western media have reported.He said that as a country that is also threatened by terrorist attacks, Malaysia can learn something from China in certain fields.
