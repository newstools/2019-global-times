In the other three, it has had above-average performances, he said "and we'll continue working with partners to improve cyber security."US President Donald Trump urged in a recent tweet that wireless technology companies step up their efforts to build 5G networks, and he cautioned against blocking any companies in pursuing this target."Due to complex reasons, Huawei does not merely exist in the US market," Guo said, noting that the US does not represent the whole world. Even without the US, the Chinese company has achieved business growth, driven by robust demand in the technology and communications industry."Our future will not be decided by that [US influence]," Guo told the Global Times.
