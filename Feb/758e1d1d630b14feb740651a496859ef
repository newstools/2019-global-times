China and the US have achieved substantial progress on specific issues following their latest round of high-level trade talks in Washington, the Chinese delegation said Sunday. A Chinese trade expert hailed the progress in the "last chance for both countries" to reach a deal. The seventh round of trade talks between China and the US, which was extended for two days, focused on details around the text of an agreement, according to Xinhua News Agency. Substantial progress on specific issues was made in technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, services, agriculture and foreign exchange rates, according to Xinhua.Chinese trade experts responded positively to the latest progress of the talks."The advancement of China-US trade ties benefits both countries. This is not only what China wants, it also brings much more benefits for the US," said Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing."Although there won't be any tariff hikes on March 1, there will still be issues to work out between the two sides; this progress coming out of a very arduous process needs to be cherished," Bai told the Global Times on Monday morning."The prospect [of the talks] is positive and China itself is looking for changes. In the fields mentioned in the Xinhua report, setting up relative rules and regulations is also appealing for Chinese side," Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Monday."The progress made by China and the US is exemplary to the development of globalization, and contributes to global governance," Chen said.While the Xinhua report said the sides will step up further at the direction of both heads of state and made no mention of a March 1 deadline, when the US was scheduled to increase a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent, US President Donald Trump said on his Twitter account the deadline will be postponed."I will be delaying the US increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1. Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude agreement," Trump tweeted on Sunday (US time)."Delaying an increase in tariffs means China-US trade talks are coming down to the most crucial moment. There won't be infinite delay, this time could be the last chance for both countries," Song Guoyou, director of Fudan University's Center for Economic Diplomacy, told the Global Times on Monday."Trump would like to settle the trade conflict before the mid-term elections near. China would like to end it soon to eliminate the uncertainties domestically and internationally," noted Song."China needs to have a bottom line on four aspects - the trade deal shouldn't change China's political system; China won't give away its economic sovereignty; China should protect its national security; China will be able to continue developing," Song said.
