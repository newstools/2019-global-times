He also noted that multilateral cooperation should focus on non-controversial topics.Current fishery management cooperation in the South China Sea is still at a very low stage and is mainly bilateral - between China and Vietnam or the Philippines - and deals mostly with law enforcement management and training on fishery techniques, said Chen Xiangmiao, a research fellow at the Hainan-based National Institute for the South China Sea.Maritime countries have different definitions of the fishing off-season and fish-ban policies, which has caused overfishing and prohibited countries from carrying out efficient fishery cooperation, analysts said. According to China's Ministry of Agriculture, China's fish-ban area covers the sea that extends north from the 12th parallel north latitude to the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong provinces. In 2018, the ban lasted about three months since May.Unclear maritime boundaries have also caused maritime conflict, which analysts suggested could be addressed based on the experience of cooperation between China and Japan in the East China Sea. The two countries should respect the rights of fishermen from both sides rather than enforcing domestic laws against foreign fidhermen.Newspaper headline: Move beyond conflicts: experts Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China eyes building next-generation fighter jets by 2035China 'likely' to see steady increase in 2019 defense budgetChinese students slam union candidate over separatist posts CA to scale back $77b high-speed rail projectSoCal alumni association of top university celebrates Chinese lunar new year120th Golden Dragon Parade held in LA How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
