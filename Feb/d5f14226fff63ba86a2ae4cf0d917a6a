We also expect the UK to maintain its true nature of opening and making wise choices based on its own interests and work with China to bring more benefits to the Chinese and British people," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a routine press conference on Monday.Financial Times said that the UK National Cyber Security Centre had determined that there are ways to limit the risks of using Huawei in future 5G ultra-fast networks, citing officials familiar with the matter.Such a decision dealt "a serious blow to US efforts to persuade allies to ban the Chinese supplier from high-speed telecommunications systems," the report said.One person familiar with the debate said the British conclusion would "carry great weight" with European leaders, since the UK has access to sensitive US intelligence through its membership in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network, the FT reported.Zhang said that the UK had been concerned about the risks of using Huawei because of warnings from the US. But Huawei products are inexpensive and qualified that they could not refuse, which was why they proposed schemes to test Huawei equipment.  Zhang hailed the system and the UK's conclusion as "significantly pragmatic, and will set an example for other European countries." Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday that it was not in European countries' interests to blindly follow the US, which was confusing security with the market to crack down on Huawei.The UK made a proper move by introducing ways to deal with 5G cooperation, Cui said. Cui noted that because of warnings from the US, there appeared to be a trend toward a new Cold War in Europe. "Because China does not share the same ideology as the US, Chinese products are unsafe, according to US logic," Cui said. He warned that conditions for a new Cold War would develop if ideology becomes the main issue.Newspaper headline: Analysts hail UK report on Huawei Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China eyes building next-generation fighter jets by 2035China 'likely' to see steady increase in 2019 defense budgetChinese students slam union candidate over separatist posts CA to scale back $77b high-speed rail projectSoCal alumni association of top university celebrates Chinese lunar new year120th Golden Dragon Parade held in LA How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
