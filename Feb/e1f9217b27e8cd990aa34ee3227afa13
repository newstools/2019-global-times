Austria's technology ministry has called on Europe to form a joint position on whether or not to allow Chinese firm Huawei to equip 5G for next-generation mobile networks. This consideration comes amid the US-hyped security concerns over Huawei and Washington's relentless efforts to thwart the 5G efforts of this leading tech company.
5G will be one of the most critical components of the digital economy and society, not only in China but also Europe. Europe has taken significant steps to lead global developments toward this strategic technology. To reposition itself as a leader in world affairs including the field of technology, Europe has no reason to reject cooperation with Huawei which has developed the most advanced 5G technology, disregarding unwarranted US claims. 
Europe is caught in the middle. While the continent treads carefully between China and the US, what is at stake is its own interests. As China tries to offer a cooperative approach, Europe, a longtime US ally, is hesitant to accept. The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China presents tremendous opportunities in terms of trade and growth, while skepticism lingers in Europe about the geopolitical ambition the initiative may harbor. 
Observers believe that the funds allocated by the EU will fall way short of what is really needed. The EU will allocate funding for this project in its next multiannual budget, which will stretch from 2021 to 2027, but can Europe afford to wait till then to walk out of its current plight?
Bloomberg has already called Europe "the real weak link in the global economy.�?The ongoing sluggishness in Greece, a protracted slump in manufacturing in Germany, and stagnant household spending in France beset by the yellow vest protests all suggest poor prospects for all of Europe.
China has never wanted to proceed alone. As Europe grapples with its own predicament, it can grasp this opportunity to cooperate. China COSCO Shipping's investment in the Greek port of Piraeus has been helping transform it into a more important transport hub. 
Reports show that by 2025 at least 31,000 jobs will be created by the Piraeus project. In Germany, Duisburg, once a steel boomtown, is returning to prosperity as a main European stop on the trade route for Chinese goods. With China opening itself more, it will import more from the EU and create more opportunities for EU companies.
Globalization and cooperation are still key agendas of today's world and  the driving forces for development. If Europe follows US footsteps and isolates China, it will miss opportunities for its own sake. It should preserve engagement with China and broaden its room for development.
