KITH's 2019 New York Fashion Week show Photos: ICOver the weekend, from Los Angeles to London, the showbiz A-list strutted their stuff on red carpets for the Grammys and Britain's Bafta film awards.Halfway between in New York, the style glitterati lined catwalks to preview the trends for next autumn and winter.The short answer? Lots of bright color and lots of sex appeal.Here are some highlights from the latest shows at New York Fashion Week, which culminates Wednesday with a presentation from Marc Jacobs:Gurung, who now has 10 years in the business behind him, looked home for inspiration to Nepal, where he recently spent some time.The result was a joyful, bright ready-to-wear collection - a theme he had introduced last season after several years of more sober designs.He played with sari draping, especially in ikat and mandala-inspired prints. No monochromatics or tone-on-tone ensembles here: purple or mustard yellow and turquoise, red and pink - women should use their imagination in Gurung's world.The designer said in his notes that he hoped to create a "multi-faceted, colorful and optimistic place where integrity, purpose, levity and love are our most celebrated virtues."As more and more US designers flee New York for London, Paris or Milan, foreign fashion houses are flocking to the Big Apple to take advantage of the style vacuum.Case in point: Venerable French label Longchamp, which is looking to develop its stateside presence, staged its second New York show.The brand - which is known for leather goods, handbags and riding gear - has opened new stores in New York and along the US West Coast. "It's very important for us to be here," the company's vice president for retail, Olivier Cassegrain, told AFP, explaining that in Paris, the company had a hard time cracking into the jam-packed schedule of heavyweight houses.For next autumn, designer Sophie Delafontaine kept it classy but sexy - embracing pleated short skirts, black studded leather and lots of looks in black and white.Even if foreign labels are rising in New York, some homegrown designers still generate buzz. Christian Siriano is one of them.From his beginnings as a winner on reality show Project Runway, the 33-year-old has quickly become one of the go-to names in Hollywood. Siriano is also known as a champion of diversity - on the runway and in his designs. When no one would dress actress Leslie Jones for the Ghostbusters premiere, he stepped up.Siriano worked his magic, unveiling a series of evening gowns in silver, black, white and deep blue.Curvy model Ashley Graham closed the show in a transparent silvery confection, as the audience cheered.
