The new rules could potentially make transferring capital in and out of China easier."China has one of the most stringent controls among countries that monitor cross-border capital flows," a foreign worker told the Global Times on condition of anonymity on Tuesday. "Moving money in and out can be a lot of pain."Dong said the mechanism will be attractive to foreign employees of Chinese companies, especially senior executives, since China's emerging capital market is quite appealing to them, as well as foreign investors.The CSRC expanded the scale of foreigners eligible for stock incentive program from those working in the mainland to all foreign employees in August 2018.Dong said the detailed rules issued by SAFE would also encourage foreigners to participate in the construction of China's capital market. "From offering national treatment to foreign companies, to offering national treatment to foreign staff in China, the country is steadily realizing its promise of a further opening-up," Dong said.Newspaper headline: SAFE issues new rules for foreigners taking part in stock incentive programs Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass China refutes Turkish FM's accusation on Xinjiang training centersChina eyes building next-generation fighter jets by 2035Huawei row goes beyond open conflict Chinese runner to finish pole-to-pole trekLA teachers strike shows failure of America's public school system2019 Rose Parade held in Pasadena How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
