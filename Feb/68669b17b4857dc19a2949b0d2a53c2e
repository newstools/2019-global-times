Chinese and US officials said that they have made "important progress" in addressing their differences over trade at the latest round of negotiations, but they left the task for a final deal to further talks, including a possible meeting between the leaders of the two countries.The latest round of high-level negotiations concluded at the White House on Thursday, local time, and both sides emerged from the meetings with a positive tone, stressing that they have made progress over a wide range of issues of mutual concern.Chinese and US officials had "candid, detailed and constructive discussions" focused on the balance of trade, technology transfer, intellectual property rights protection, implementation mechanisms and other topics of mutual interest, as well as issues of China's concern, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday. "[The two sides] made important progress for the current stage."In a statement on Thursday, the White House also described the trade negotiations as "productive." It said that "the two sides showed a helpful willingness to engage on all major issues, and the negotiating sessions featured productive and technical discussions on how to resolve our differences.""The fruitful discussions of the latest round of China-US trade talks showed the two sides have full willingness and consensus to end the ongoing trade war, and to reach a deal before the 90-day trade truce deadline," Tu Xinquan, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday.The two countries are scrambling to reach a final deal before March 1 to avoid a further escalation in their tit-for-tat tariff war. While no final deal has reached during the trade talks in Washington, signs suggest that the two sides had reached a consensus on some of the major issues of division.Consensus reached In terms of market fairness, the Xinhua report said that creating a fair market environment is in line with the broad direction of China's reform and opening-up and China will "actively" respond to the US' concern.China will also expand purchasing agricultural, energy and manufacturing goods and services from the US to meet the demands of its high-quality economic growth and people's needs, Xinhua reported. Both sides also agreed that an effective two-way mechanism to verify implementation on both sides is of "great importance," it said.The officials also had discussions about the "specific concerns" of China, and that the US side will "seriously" respond to those concerns, Xinhua reported, though it did not further elaborate on the concerns."Reading from the official statements of both sides, we can see China's requests are not specifically mentioned," Mei Xinyu, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday. He noted that China's concerns were not specifically mentioned because it could have a "direct influence" on markets, while the US' concerns are well-known and China has already vowed to address them at its own initiative.For example, Mei said that China's support for strategic high-tech industries will not be shaken.Surrounding the trade negotiations is a dispute between the countries over Huawei Technologies Co, which has been accused by the US of a series of violations. China has pushed back such accusations, saying the US' move is politically charged. But the topic was not discussed in the negotiations, according to US President Donald Trump. "No, we haven't discussed that yet. It will be," Trump said at the Oval Office on Thursday, in response to a question about the Huawei case.Still, "China and the US are making headways to nail down a deal," Mei added.Good spiritOfficials from both sides appeared positive toward each other and in generally good spirits, following the two-day high-level talks, which ended with a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the Oval Office.At the meeting, Liu conveyed a message from Chinese President Xi Jinping to Trump, in which the Chinese president sent his Chinese New Year wishes to Trump and his family and said he hopes the two sides could reach a "mutually beneficial" agreement as soon as possible through consultations based on "mutual respect and a win-win cooperation attitude," according to Xinhua. "That's a beautiful letter and we appreciate it," Trump said at the Oval Office meeting after he was read the letter. In a rare move unseen in previous rounds of talks, the White House statement also included praises for the Chinese delegation, led by Liu. "[The US] appreciates the preparation, diligence, and professionalism shown throughout these meetings by Vice Premier Liu He and his team," it reads.Further talksBoth Chinese and US officials suggested that they are both committed to further discussions to end the trade war, which has started to weigh on the economic growth and financial markets in both countries, as well as around the world. The Xinhua report said that the two sides have confirmed a timetable and roadmap for the next rounds of consultations, while the White House statement said that the US "looks forward to further talks with China on these vital topics."There are also hints, mostly from the US side, that there could be a meeting between the top leaders of the two countries before March 1. On Thursday, Trump tweeted that "no final deal will be made until my friend President Xi, and I, meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points."But Trump reiterated in his series of tweets that US tariffs on Chinese products will increase if a deal was not reached by March 1, leading many to speculate that a Xi-Trump meeting will take place before that time.Asked about meeting in the Oval Office, Trump said that the meeting had not yet been set up. "But I have a feeling it will be agreed to pretty quickly by both countries. Both countries would like to see a positive result."The Xinhua report cited Trump as saying that he is looking forward to meeting with Xi and witnessing the historic moment of China and the US reaching an agreement.But before that, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin will lead a team to China in mid-February for further talks, according to Xinhua.However, even if the two sides reach a deal, the divisions between the world's two largest economies will remain, analysts said."The two countries will still face some frictions… China-US bilateral relations may now feature a pattern of 'co-existence in struggle', differing from the previous pattern of seeking unity in struggle," Mei said.Zhang Hongpei and Zhang Dan contributed to this story Backgrounder: the AIIB explainedImpact of anti-corruption campaignBig changes in China's top military brass J-16 fighter jet stealth-capable, able to carry all types of Chinese air-to-surface weaponsXi extends Spring Festival greetings to non-Communist parties, personagesForcing allies to pick sides, US destabilizes world order Chinese runner to finish pole-to-pole trekLA teachers strike shows failure of America's public school system2019 Rose Parade held in Pasadena How To Say Love To A Chinese Girl
