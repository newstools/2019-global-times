Michael Cohen, US President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, is sworn in to testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC on Wednesday. Photo: AFP Wednesday's congressional testimony of Michael Cohen, the former lawyer of US President Donald Trump, will have a negligible impact on trade negotiations between China and the US, Chinese experts said Thursday.Cohen told the House Oversight Committee that Trump directed him to lie last year about the hush payments made to porn actress Stormy Daniels to silence her claims of an affair with Trump, and that Trump wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow amid his election campaign.After his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam was cut short on Thursday, Trump told reporters that "Cohen lied a lot" during the testimony in Washington."I think having a fake hearing like that and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing," Trump said.  "It is unlikely to have any direct impact on the trade negotiations between China and the US," said Sun Chenghao, an assistant research fellow at the Institute of American Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. "Trump's team may need some time to handle Cohen's accusations, which means other work will slow down a little."Cohen's testimony produced no new evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia during the presidential campaign in 2016, or evidence of financial crimes by the president and his Trump Organization - subjects at the center of multiple federal and congressional investigations.Cohen called the president a "conman" and said Trump knew in advance about the release of the WikiLeaks dump of stolen e-mails aimed at hurting his Democratic rival Hilary Clinton in the 2016 election campaign.Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of American Studies in Beijing, said that if Cohen provides no more evidence to back up his accusations, it will only undermine his own reputation rather than Trump's."There are just emotional words that are not supported by evidence," Liu told the Global Times, noting there is yet to be direct evidence proving that Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential election."Accusations alone are unlikely to undermine Trump's presidency as the public has got tired of this so-called Russian meddling," Liu said. Cohen, a 52-year-old New Yorker, wrapped up his testimony by warning that the US president may not accept a "peaceful transition of power" if he loses re-election in 2020. The US will have another presidential election next year, with veteran Democrat Bernie Sanders having joined the race, alongside other Democratic contenders. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress in 2017 among other crimes. His sentence begins in May.Cohen was expected to testify to the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors over the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election on Thursday.
